abstract = {A key ingredient in the current proposal of the DSM-5 Work Group on Personality and Personality Disorders is the assessment of overall severity of impairment in personality functioning: the Levels of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS). The aim of this article is to contribute a conceptual and empirical discussion of the LPFS from the perspective of the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis (OPD) system (OPD Task Force, 2008 ). First, we introduce the OPD Levels of Structural Integration Axis (OPD-LSIA), a measure of individual differences in severity of personality dysfunction that is rooted in psychodynamic theory. We show that the OPD-LSIA is reliable, valid, and highly associated with observer ratings of personality disorders. In the second part, we present results from an OPD expert consensus study exploring potential limitations of the current LPFS item set from the perspective of the OPD-LSIA. We conclude with highlighting implications for future revisions of the DSM-5 proposal.},

@article{Stanghellini2007,
abstract = {This is an explorative study on the values of persons with schizophrenia based on transcripts of individual therapy sessions conducted for 40 persons with chart diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizotypal disorder. Values are action-guiding attitudes that subject human activities to be worthy of praise or blame. The schizophrenic value system conveys an overall crisis of common sense. The outcome of this has been designated as antagonomia and idionomia. Antagonomia reflects the choice to take an eccentric stand in the face of commonly shared assumptions and the here and now "other." Idionomia reflects the feeling of the radical uniqueness and exceptionality of one's being with respect to common sense and the other human beings. This sentiment of radical exceptionality is felt as a "gift," often in view of an eschatological mission or a vocation to a superior, novel, metaphysical understanding of the world. The aim of this study is neither establishing new diagnostic criteria nor suggesting that values play an etio-pathogenetical role in the development of schizophrenia but improving our understanding of the "meaning" of schizophrenic experiences and beliefs, and by doing so reducing stigmatization, and enhancing the specificity and validity of "psychotic symptoms" (especially bizarre delusions) and of "social and occupational dysfunction" through a detailed description of the anthropological and existential matrix they arise from.},

METHOD: Magnetic resonance imaging using voxel-based morphometry was performed on 122 people with first-episode psychosis and 94 controls. RESULTS: There were significant decreases in grey matter in the left superior temporal and inferior prefrontal cortices, insula bilaterally and the right hippocampal region in first-episode psychosis (P{\textless}0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). The subgroup of people with schizophrenia (n=62) exhibited a similar pattern of decrease in grey matter relative to controls.

abstract = {Conceptions of mental illness in children are bound by cultural and social conventions of what constitutes healthy and unhealthy development. To understand current conceptualizations of disorders in children, we review the history of these conceptualizations from three intertwined perspectives: a sociopolitical history of American children and families, the history of the mental health fields and scientific disciplines involved in diagnosing children, and the evolution of children's role in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. We review where the field has been in its conception of childhood mental illness throughout the past century, where we believe it is now, and raise questions about the direction in which child diagnosis may be headed as we enter the new millennium. We conclude with social policy recommendations based on theory and research regarding mental disorders in children.},

abstract = {Graphic processing units (GPUs) are rapidly gaining maturity as powerful general parallel computing devices. A key feature in the development of modern GPUs has been the advancement of the programming model and programming tools. Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a software platform for massively parallel high-performance computing on Nvidia many-core GPUs. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the volume of the data to be processed, and the type of statistical analysis to perform call for high-performance computing strategies. In this work, we present the main features of the R-CUDA package cudaBayesreg which implements in CUDA the core of a Bayesian multilevel model for the analysis of brain fMRI data. The statistical model implements a Gibbs sampler for multilevel/hierarchical linear models with a normal prior. The main contribution for the increased performance comes from the use of separate threads for fitting the linear regression model at each voxel in parallel. The R-CUDA implementation of the Bayesian model proposed here has been able to reduce significantly the run-time processing of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations used in Bayesian fMRI data analyses. Presently, cudaBayesreg is only configured for Linux systems with Nvidia CUDA support.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically review the effectiveness of co-therapy compared with monotherapy for people with bipolar mania. METHOD: MEDLINE, Embase, Psychinfo, The Cochrane Library and reference lists of retrieved studies were searched without language restrictions for randomized controlled trials evaluating co-therapy compared with monotherapy for acute bipolar mania. Each trial was assessed for susceptibility to bias. Data on mania outcomes, withdrawals, extrapyramidal symptoms and weight were extracted and pooled effect estimates summarized as relative risks (RR) or differences in mean values (MD) where appropriate. RESULTS: Eight eligible studies were included (1124 participants). Significant reductions in mania (Young Mania Rating Scale, YMRS) scores were shown for haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine as co-therapy compared with monotherapy with a mood stabilizer. For atypical antipsychotics combined, the pooled difference in mean scores was 4.41 (95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI: 2.74, 6.07). Significantly more participants on co-therapy met the response criterion (at least 50{\{}{\%}{\}} reduction in YMRS score), RR 1.53 (1.31, 1.80). With some drugs, co-therapy decreased tolerability compared with monotherapy, and resulted in greater weight gain. There were insufficient data to compare one co-therapy regimen with another. CONCLUSION: The addition of antipsychotic treatment to established mood-stabilizer treatment is more effective than mood-stabilizer treatment alone.},

Data from 113 studies (4365 patients and 3429 controls) were combined in a meta-analysis carried out on the five cognitive domains of IQ, memory, language, executive function, and attention. Studies were excluded where they lacked a suitable control group or failed to present complete information. In all five cognitive domains, analysis indicated a consistent trend for patients to perform more poorly than healthy controls, with significant heterogeneity across studies. Sources of heterogeneity were analyzed and a need to ensure more appropriate composition of patient and control groups and to adopt a more refined and methodologically correct, hypothesis-driven approach was identified.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A growing body of evidence points to the clinical and heuristic value of anomalous subjective experiences (ASEs) for the characterization of schizophrenia spectrum vulnerability and early detection purposes. In particular, a subgroup of ASEs, entailing basic disorders of self-awareness (self-disorders SDs), has been shown to constitute a core feature of both clinically overt and latent (schizotaxic) spectrum phenotypes. However, a major limitation for the translational implementation of this research evidence has been a lack of assessment tools capable of encompassing the clinical richness of SDs. Here, we present the initial normative data and psychometric properties of a newly developed instrument (Examination of Anomalous Self-experience EASE), specifically designed to support the psychopathological exploration of SDs in both research and "real world" clinical settings.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of episodes of DSM-IV major depression, as well as their identification rates, in elderly inpatients in a general hospital in Greece. METHODS: 200 selected patients, 65 years old and over, hospitalized in Surgery and Internal Medicine Departments, were assessed for major depression over a period of 12 months (October 2006-November 2007) by means of SCID-I/P, HADS, BDI and GDS-15. During the same period, liaison calls from the same departments were evaluated and findings were compared. RESULTS: When psychiatric screening was performed, 28 patients (14{\%}) were diagnosed as suffering from a major depressive episode. During the same period, there were only 20 liaison calls from the same departments for patients over 65 years old, from which 4 patients were found to be suffering from major depression. Comparison between the two periods showed significant underestimation of depression. All psychometric scales detected depression sufficiently. CONCLUSIONS: In general hospital elderly inpatients, depression still remains underestimated. Depression symptom scales could be used as routine tests for screening major depression.},

abstract = {Recent focus on early detection and intervention in psychosis has renewed interest in subtle psychopathology beyond positive and negative symptoms. Such self-experienced sub-clinical disturbances are described in detail by the basic symptom concept. This review will give an introduction into the concept of basic symptoms and describe the development of the current instruments for their assessment, the Schizophrenia Proneness Instrument, Adult (SPI-A) and Child and Youth version (SPI-CY), as well as of the two at-risk criteria: the at-risk criterion Cognitive-Perceptive Basic Symptoms (COPER) and the high-risk criterion Cognitive Disturbances (COGDIS). Further, an overview of prospective studies using both or either basic symptom criteria and transition rates related to these will be given, and the potential benefit of combining ultra-high risk criteria, particularly attenuated psychotic symptoms, and basic symptom criteria will be discussed. Finally, their prevalence in psychosis patients, i.e. the sensitivity, as well as in general population samples will be described. It is concluded that both COPER and COGDIS are able to identify subjects at a high risk of developing psychosis. Further, they appear to be sufficiently frequent prior to onset of the first psychotic episode as well as sufficiently rare in persons of general population to be considered as valuable for an early detection of psychosis.},

Thus, it is interesting that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) established atheoretical guidelines for mental disorder diagnosis. Five experiments investigated how clinicians handled an atheoretical nosology. Clinicians' causal theories of disorders and their responses on diagnostic and memory tasks were measured. Participants were more likely to diagnose a hypothetical patient with a disorder if that patient had causally central rather than causally peripheral symptoms according to their theory of the disorder. Their memory for causally central symptoms was also biased. Clinicians are cognitively driven to use theories despite decades of practice with the atheoretical DSM.},

abstract = {Chromosome 5q21-33 has been implicated in harboring risk genes for schizophrenia. In this paper, we report evidence that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in and around interleukin 3 (IL3) are associated with the disease in the Irish Study of High-Density Schizophrenia Families (ISHDSF), the Irish Case-Control Study of Schizophrenia (ICCSS) and the Irish Trio Study of Schizophrenia (ITRIO). The associations are sex-specific and depend on the family history (FH) of schizophrenia. In all three samples, rs31400 shows female-specific and FH-dependent associations (P=0.0062, 0.0647 and 0.0284 for the ISHDSF, ICCSS and ITRIO, respectively). Several markers have similar associations in one or two of the three samples. In haplotype analyses, identical risk and protective haplotypes are identified in the ISHDSF and ITRIO samples in several multimarker combinations. For ICCSS, the same haplotypes are implicated; however, the risk haplotypes observed in the family samples become protective. Several significant markers, rs440970, rs31400 and rs2069803, are located in and around known estrogen response elements, promoter and enhancer of the IL3 gene. They may explain the sex-specific associations and be functional for the expression of IL3 gene.},

abstract = {Objectives: Substance abuse is a well established risk factor for First-Episode Psychosis (FEP), but its influence on FEP course is less clear. Starting from our baseline observation that substance users were younger than non-users at the psychosis onset, we hypothesized that substance use at baseline could be an independent risk factor for a worse clinical course. Methods: An incidence cohort of patients with FEP collected in an 8. year period (2002-2009) at the Bologna West Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) was assessed at baseline and at 12. month follow-up. Drop-out, hospitalizations and service utilization were used as clinical outcomes. Results: Most of the patients were still in contact with CMHC at 12. month follow up. Substance users had a significantly higher rate of hospitalizations during the follow-up after adjusting for age, gender and other potential confounders (OR 5.84, 95{\%} CI 2.44-13.97, p. ≤. 0.001). Conclusions: This study adds to previous evidence showing the independent effect of substance use on FEP course. The identification of a "potentially modifiable" environmental predictor of the course of the illness such as substance use at psychosis onset allows us to envisage the possibility of ameliorating the course of the illness by managing this factor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This relationship is used to design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e., water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors are made in diffusion NMR spectroscopy and imaging of anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff are ignored, most notably the loss of information needed to determine fiber orientation. Estimation of Deff provides the theoretical basis for a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor imaging, which provides information about tissue microstructure and its physiologic state not contained in scalar quantities such as T1, T2, proton density, or the scalar apparent diffusion constant.},

abstract = {Higher-order cognitive functions are supported by distributed networks of multiple interconnected cortical and subcortical regions. Efficient cognitive processing depends on fast communication between these regions, so the integrity of the connections between them is of great importance. It is known that white matter (WM) development is a slow process, continuing into adulthood. While the significance of cortical maturation for intellectual development is described, less is known about the relationships between cognitive functions and maturation of WM connectivity. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the associations between intellectual abilities and development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived measures of WM microstructure in 168 right-handed participants aged 8-30 years. Independently of age and sex, both verbal and performance abilities were positively related to fractional anisotropy (FA) and negatively related to mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD), predominantly in the left hemisphere. Further, verbal, but not performance abilities, were associated with developmental differences in DTI indices in widespread regions in both hemispheres. Regional analyses showed relations with both FA and RD bilaterally in the anterior thalamic radiation and the cortico-spinal tract and in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. In these regions, our results suggest that participants with high verbal abilities may show accelerated WM development in late childhood and a subsequent earlier developmental plateau, in contrast to a steadier and prolonged development in participants with average verbal abilities. Longitudinal data are needed to validate these interpretations. The results provide insight into the neurobiological underpinnings of intellectual development.},

abstract = {This study aimed to better understand how minor mental health problems (MMPs) are perceived by well-educated urban dwellers in China who are influenced by Western values. Urban China is a rapidly changing society in which traditional Chinese culture and Western thought coexist. As a result, the established processes of interdependent self-appraisal have been challenged and a sense of a bicultural self has developed among a growing proportion of the population. The fieldwork for this study included interviews and observations. The results are derived mainly from interviews with professional practitioners, students, and lay people from three urban sites. One of the main findings was that respondents who referred to traditional and collectivistic Chinese values tended not to label MMPs as psychiatric disorders or illnesses but as challenges in daily life and relationships strain. While the Western medical model of MMPs considers them a form of illness, they were not viewed in this way in traditional collectivistic China in the past, even among educated urban dwellers. However, the urban and educated Chinese who have developed a stronger sense of a bicultural self are now more likely to perceive and deal with MMPs from a Western viewpoint.},

abstract = {Causation is an essential concept in epidemiology, yet there is no single, clearly articulated definition for the discipline. From a systematic review of the literature, five categories can be delineated: production, necessary and sufficient, sufficient-component, counterfactual, and probabilistic. Strengths and weaknesses of these categories are examined in terms of proposed characteristics of a useful scientific definition of causation: it must be specific enough to distinguish causation from mere correlation, but not so narrow as to eliminate apparent causal phenomena from consideration. Two categories-production and counterfactual-are present in any definition of causation but are not themselves sufficient as definitions. The necessary and sufficient cause definition assumes that all causes are deterministic. The sufficient-component cause definition attempts to explain probabilistic phenomena via unknown component causes. Thus, on both of these views, heavy smoking can be cited as a cause of lung cancer only when the existence of unknown deterministic variables is assumed. The probabilistic definition, however, avoids these assumptions and appears to best fit the characteristics of a useful definition of causation. It is also concluded that the probabilistic definition is consistent with scientific and public health goals of epidemiology. In debates in the literature over these goals, proponents of epidemiology as pure science tend to favour a narrower deterministic notion of causation models while proponents of epidemiology as public health tend to favour a probabilistic view. The authors argue that a single definition of causation for the discipline should be and is consistent with both of these aims. It is concluded that a counterfactually-based probabilistic definition is more amenable to the quantitative tools of epidemiology, is consistent with both deterministic and probabilistic phenomena, and serves equally well for the acquisition and the application of scientific knowledge.},

abstract = {In 2002, Norway experienced a large outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in hospitals with 231 confirmed cases. This fuelled intense public and professional debates on what were the causes and who were responsible. In epidemiology, other sciences, in philosophy and in law there is a long tradition of discussing the concept of causality. We use this outbreak as a case; apply various theories of causality from different disciplines to discuss the roles and responsibilities of some of the parties involved. Mackie's concept of INUS conditions, Hill's nine viewpoints to study association for claiming causation, deterministic and probabilistic ways of reasoning, all shed light on the issues of causality in this outbreak. Moreover, applying legal theories of causation (counterfactual reasoning and the "but-for" test and the NESS test) proved especially useful, but the case also illustrated the weaknesses of the various theories of causation.We conclude that many factors contributed to causing the outbreak, but that contamination of a medical device in the production facility was the major necessary condition. The reuse of the medical device in hospitals contributed primarily to the size of the outbreak. The unintended error by its producer--and to a minor extent by the hospital practice--was mainly due to non-application of relevant knowledge and skills, and appears to constitute professional negligence. Due to criminal procedure laws and other factors outside the discourse of causality, no one was criminally charged for the outbreak which caused much suffering and shortening the life of at least 34 people.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased mortality risk and its moderators is an important, but still under recognized, negative outcome of late-life depression (LLD). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether LLD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in a population-based study with over 10 years of follow-up, and addressed the moderating effect of gender and symptom severity on mortality risk.

METHODS: This analysis used data from the Bambu{\'{i}} Cohort Study of Aging. The study population comprised 1.508 (86.5{\%}) of all eligible 1.742 elderly residents. Depressive symptoms were annually evaluated by the GHQ-12, with scores of five or higher indicating clinically significant depression. From 1997 to 2007, 441 participants died during 10,648 person-years of follow-up. We estimated the hazard ratio for mortality risk by Cox regression analyses.

RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were a risk factor for all-cause mortality after adjusting for confounding lifestyle and clinical factors (adjusted HR = 1.24 CI95{\%} [1.00-1.55], P = .05). Mortality risk was significantly elevated in men (adjusted HR = 1.45 CI95{\%} [1.01-2.07], P = 0.04), but not in women (adjusted HR = 1.13 CI95{\%} [0.84-1.48], P = 0.15). We observed a significant interaction between gender and depressive symptoms on mortality risk ((HR = 1.72 CI95{\%} [1.18-2.49], P = 0.004).

CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that LLD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in the elderly, especially in men. The prevention and adequate treatment of LLD may help to reduce premature disability and death among elders with depressive symptoms.},

Although these 'rules' were actually conceived of as guidelines upon which to establish microbial causality and their implementation resulted in many new discoveries, they also had the unintended effect of limiting the interpretation of novel findings.

@article{Battaglia2005,
abstract = {Acute agitation occurs in a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions, and when severe can result in behavioural dyscontrol. Rapid tranquillisation is the assertive use of medication to calm severely agitated patients quickly, decrease dangerous behaviour and allow treatment of the underlying condition. Intramuscular injections of typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, given alone or in combination, have been the treatment of choice over the past few decades. Haloperidol and lorazepam are the most widely used agents for acute agitation, are effective in a wide diagnostic arena and can be used in medically compromised patients. Haloperidol can cause significant extrapyramidal symptoms, and has rarely been associated with cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. Lorazepam can cause ataxia, sedation and has additive effects with other CNS depressant drugs.Recently, two fast-acting preparations of atypical antipsychotics, intramuscular ziprasidone and intramuscular olanzapine, have been developed for treatment of acute agitation. Intramuscular ziprasidone has shown significant calming effects emerging 30 minutes after administration for acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia and other nonspecific psychotic conditions. Intramuscular ziprasidone is well tolerated and has gained widespread use in psychiatric emergency services since its introduction in 2002. In comparison with other atypical antipsychotics, ziprasidone has a relatively greater propensity to increase the corrected QT (QTc) interval and, therefore, should not be used in patients with known QTc interval-associated conditions. Intramuscular olanzapine has shown faster onset of action, greater efficacy and fewer adverse effects than haloperidol or lorazepam in the treatment of acute agitation associated with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar mania and dementia. Intramuscular olanzapine has been shown to have distinct calming versus nonspecific sedative effects. The recent reports of adverse events (including eight fatalities) associated with intramuscular olanzapine underscores the need to follow strict prescribing guidelines and avoid simultaneous use with other CNS depressants. Both intramuscular ziprasidone and intramuscular olanzapine have shown ease of transition to same-agent oral therapy once the episode of acute agitation has diminished. No randomised, controlled studies have examined either agent in patients with severe agitation, drug-induced states or significant medical comorbidity. Current clinical experience and one naturalistic study with intramuscular ziprasidone suggest that it is efficacious and can be safely used in such populations. These intramuscular atypical antipsychotics may represent a historical advance in the treatment of acute agitation.},

We investigated the clinical utility of the Multilingual Aphasia Examination-Spanish (MAE-S) in the evaluation of language functions of Hispanic subjects post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). The performance of 40 TBI patients was compared to that of 40 age-, gender-, and education-matched normal controls. Subject groups differed on the Visual Naming (VN), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA), and Token Test subtests. The VN and COWA subtests were the best discriminators of group membership. Distribution of scores for the patient group on the Rating of Articulation scale additionally indicate subtle articulatory difficulties post-TBI. For all subtests, trauma severity per Glasgow Coma Scale was the best predictor of language performance, over and above the contribution of other clinical and demographic variables. These results are consistent with prior reports of dysphasia post-TBI and suggest that the MAE-S is a sensitive and accurate measure to assess language disturbances in Hispanic populations.},

abstract = {Increased mean diffusivity (MD) is hypothesized to reflect tissue degeneration and may provide subtle indicators of neuropathology as well as age-related brain changes in the absence of volumetric differences. Our aim was to determine the degree to which genetic and environmental variation in subcortical MD is distinct from variation in subcortical volume. Data were derived from a sample of 387 male twins (83 MZ twin pairs, 55 DZ twin pairs, and 111 incomplete twin pairs) who were MRI scanned as part of the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Quantitative estimates of MD and volume for 7 subcortical regions were obtained: thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. After adjusting for covariates, bivariate twin models were fitted to estimate the size and significance of phenotypic, genotypic, and environmental correlations between MD and volume at each subcortical region. With the exception of the amygdala, familial aggregation in MD was entirely explained by additive genetic factors across all subcortical regions with estimates ranging from 46 to 84{\%}. Based on bivariate twin modeling, variation in subcortical MD appears to be both genetically and environmentally unrelated to individual differences in subcortical volume. Therefore, subcortical MD may be an alternative biomarker of brain morphology for complex traits worthy of future investigation. Hum Brain Mapp, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc},

Four different versions of the medical model are described and compared with respect to these dimensions. The medical models vary in several ways, but all can be considered "essentialistic." As a counter to the essentialist homogeneity among the medical models, two nominalist analyses of psychiatric classification are reviewed. In order to fill out the space defined by the conceptual dimensions, two alternatives to medical model approaches are also described. After making some suggestions about where DSM-V might best be aligned with respect to the conceptual dimensions, the authors review the distinction between empirical and nonempirical aspects of classification--and argue that nonempirical aspects of classification are legitimate and necessary.},

abstract = {Brief self-report questionnaires that assess attenuated psychosis symptoms have the potential to quickly and effectively screen many people who may benefit from clinical monitoring or early intervention. The current study sought to examine and compare the criterion validities of attenuated symptoms screening tools with diagnoses obtained from the clinician-administered Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes (SIPS). Three screening questionnaires (Prime Screen, Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief, and Youth Psychosis At-Risk Questionnaire-Brief) were administered just prior to the SIPS interview in a sample of adolescents and young adults seeking mental health services. Using thresholds recommended by instrument authors as well as empirically derived optimal thresholds, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and overall accuracy of each self-report measure with regard to SIPS diagnosis were obtained. Screeners correlated highly with the SIPS and demonstrated equivalent overall efficiency in capturing psychosis risk status. All three screeners appear to be useful and valid assessment tools for attenuated symptoms, with each instrument demonstrating relative benefits. The validation of attenuated symptoms screening tools is an important step toward enabling early, wide-reaching identification of individuals on a course toward psychotic illness.},

abstract = {This fMRI study was set up to explore how cognitive empathy, i.e. the cognitive inference on another person's affective state, can be characterized as a distinct brain function relating to pre-existing neurofunctional concepts about mentalizing and empathy. In a 3 Tesla MRI scanner 28 healthy participants were presented with four different instructions randomly combined with 32 false-belief cartoon stories of 3 subsequent pictures free of direct cues for affective states, like e.g. facial expressions. Participants were instructed to judge affective or visuospatial changes from their own (1st person perspective) or the protagonists' (3rd person perspective, 3rdpp) perspective. 3rdpp-judgements about affective states differed from visuospatial 3rdpp judgements by a significantly higher activation of the anterior mentalizing network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles) and the limbic system (left amygdala and hippocampus). Analysis of main effects revealed that the anterior part of the mentalizing network was activated significantly stronger by affective compared to visuospatial content. In contrast, the temporoparietal junction was rather activated by 3rdpp visuospatial judgements. After all, our results demonstrate a functional dissociation between cognitive empathy and cognitive visuospatial perspective taking. The simultaneous activation of the cortical mentalizing network and the amygdala indicates that cognitive empathy actually involves reference to own affective states in the observer. Notably, the cognitive reference to own affective states activated the mentalizing network as well. Moreover our results support pre-existing ideas about a functional anterior-posterior subdivision of the mentalizing network, depending on affective content and 3rd person perspective of cognition.},

abstract = {The DSM-IV major depression "bereavement exclusion" (BE), which recognizes that depressive symptoms are sometimes normal in recently bereaved individuals, is proposed for elimination in DSM-5. Evidence cited for the BE's invalidity comes from two 2007 reviews purporting to show that bereavement-related depression is similar to other depression across various validators, and a 2010 review of subsequent research. We examined whether the 2007 and 2010 reviews and subsequent relevant literature support the BE's invalidity. Findings were: a) studies included in the 2007 reviews sampled bereavement-related depression groups most of whom were not BE-excluded, making them irrelevant for evaluating BE validity; b) three subsequent studies cited by the 2010 review as supporting BE elimination did examine BE-excluded cases but were in fact inconclusive; and c) two more recent articles comparing recurrence of BE-excluded and other major depressive disorder cases both support the BE's validity. We conclude that the claimed evidence for the BE's invalidity does not exist. The evidence in fact supports the BE's validity and its retention in DSM-5 to prevent false positive diagnoses. We suggest some improvements to increase validity and mitigate risk of false negatives.},

The structure of this article is as follows: first, I will give a general sketch of the most important contemporary approaches to causation. Next, in the second part, I will briefly discuss the historical development of the concept of cause; I will show that the history of the concept of cause reveals a complex evolution marked by two decisive milestones: (I) the Aristotelian (-scholastic) Conception, and (II) the Scientific Conception, which are two mutually incompatible conceptions. In the third part, I will discuss some fundamental presuppositions of the received view regard­ing causation. I will show that this view is inadequate in several respects, and that this inadequacy is (partly) due to the failure to recognize the historical roots of concepts related to causation. More particularly, it will be shown that the received view is based upon two incompatible categoreal frameworks, which have their origin in, respectively, Aristotle's philosophy and the seventeenth century scientific worldview. Finally, in the fourth part, I will summarize the obtained results.},

abstract = {Symptom development during the prodromal phase of psychosis was explored retrospectively in first-episode psychosis patients with special emphasis on the assumed time-related syndromic sequence of "unspecific symptoms (UN)-predictive basic symptoms (BS)-attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS)-(transient) psychotic symptoms (PS)." Onset of syndromes was defined by first occurrence of any of their respective symptoms. Group means were inspected for time differences between syndromes and influence of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on the recalled sequence. The sequence of "UN-BS/APS-PS" was clearly supported, and both BS and, though slightly less, APS were highly sensitive. However, onset of BS and APS did not show significant time difference in the whole sample (N = 126; 90{\{}{\%}{\}} schizophrenia), although when each symptom is considered independently, APS tended to occur later than first predictive BS. On descriptive level, about one-third each recalled an earlier, equal and later onset of BS compared with APS. Level of education showed the greatest impact on the recall of the hypothesized sequence. Thereby, those with a higher school-leaving certificate supported the assumed sequence, whereas those of low educational background retrospectively dated APS before BS. These findings rather point out recognition and recall bias inherent to the retrospective design than true group characteristics. Future long-term prospective studies will have to explore this conclusively. However, as regards the criteria, the results support the notion of BS as at least a complementary approach to the ultrahigh risk criteria, which may also allow for an earlier detection of psychosis.},

Recent worldwide attempts to establish programs for early detection and therapeutic intervention in schizophrenia have inadvertently revealed an embarrassing lacuna in the contemporary operationalist psychopathology, i.e., a lack of descriptions of subtle pathology that might be useful for early, prodromal diagnosis (2). This state of affairs is, to a non-trivial extent, caused by a dramatic simplification of psychopathology that has taken place over the last decades, now echoed by raising concerns expressed in the editorials of major journals (3-6). The operational diagnostic criteria specify in detail what schizophrenia is not (e.g. not an affective or organic disorder) rather than affording the psychiatrist with a solid conceptual-clinical grip of what it is (3). Yet, a crucial and primary component of the diagnostic validity is exactly to offer a certain conceptualization or typification of what a given disorder is in the first place (7), an aspect that is conspicuously absent in the contemporary nosological debates. All classic psychopathologists agreed that, diagnostically speaking, a certain characteristic Gestalt, irreducible to single symptoms or signs, distinguished the schizophrenia spectrum from other disorders. The terms used in this context were 'diagnosis through intuition' (8), 'atmospheric diagnosis' (9), 'Praecox Gef{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}hl' (10), and 'diagnostic par p{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}n{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}tration' (11). All these terms converge in pointing to an intersubjective nature of this Gestalt. The concept of autism, introduced by Bleuler in 1911 (12), was the first thorough attempt to capture the clinical essence of schizophrenia and therefore played an important role in its definitions until the advent of the operational criteria. It will serve us as a departure in addressing the phenomenology of the trait features of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders.},

abstract = {The mediation myth is the false belief that mediation is actually estimated in the typical mediation analysis. This myth is based on a trifecta of shortcomings: (1) the typical mediation study relies on an inadequate design; (2) the researcher uses a flawed analysis strategy; and (3) there is scant attention to assumptions that are required when estimating mediation. These problems stem from overgeneralizing the classical product method for estimating mediation and overreliance on statistical significance testing as a decision criterion in mediation analysis. The goals of this article are to (1) raise awareness of these difficulties among researchers and (2) provide a roadmap about design and analysis options for a more rigorous and scientifically valid approach to mediation analysis.

Patients with the lowest IQ scores had the least severe positive symptoms but symptomatology was not related to age or extent of intellectual decline. Speed of functioning was relatively more impaired than level of intellectual functioning, with cognitive speed being more affected than motor speed. The severity of negative but not positive symptoms was significantly related to the severity of bradyphrenia (cognitive slowing), a result which would be consistent with the notion of a subcortical pathology in patients with Type II schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The intense clinical and research interest in early psychosis in recent years has highlighted a range of ethical issues which need to be considered carefully. Our perspective is based on 16 years of clinical and research experience with young people at this phase of illness as well as the research contributions of many others. We discuss the ethical dilemmas in relation to the three key foci, which make up the early psychosis paradigm. These are the pre-psychotic or prodromal phase, the period of untreated psychosis and the first psychotic episode and the critical period of recovery, which follows this. Most attention is devoted to the pre-psychotic period, however ethical considerations related to research in the other two clinical foci are briefly covered as well. Our contention is that the ethical issues are essentially identical to those arising in early intervention research in mainstream medicine. This has been concealed by inconsistency and emotion, which has great potential to confuse, politicize and derail rational debate. The legacy of the isolation of psychiatry from medicine and consequent prejudice and stigma in the professional as well as the public mind seems to be fuelling a tendency in some societies to view psychiatric research as qualitatively different from other medical research. Sound clinical research data should be allowed to illuminate the options for potential consumers across all phases of illness. The alternative is research paralysis, which would force clinical practice to expand blindly without an evidence base. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We directly tested the hypothesis that such individuals nevertheless fail to mentalize spontaneously. To this end, we used an eye-tracking task that has revealed the spontaneous ability to mentalize in typically developing infants. We showed that, like infants, neurotypical adults' (n = 17 participants) eye movements anticipated an actor's behavior on the basis of her false belief. This was not the case for individuals with Asperger syndrome (n = 19). Thus, these individuals do not attribute mental states spontaneously, but they may be able to do so in explicit tasks through compensatory learning.},

abstract = {The foundations of brain architecture are established early in life through a continuous series of dynamic interactions in which environmental conditions and personal experiences have a significant impact on how genetic predispositions are expressed. New scientific research shows that early social experiences can actually influence how genes are expressed. Thus, the old-school concepts that genes are "chiseled in stone" or that they alone determine development have been disproven. The discovery of the epigenome provides an explanation, at the molecular level, for why and how early positive and negative social experiences give rise to a biological memory that can have lifelong impacts. Signatures associated with the epigenome can be temporary or permanent, affect multiple organ systems, and increase the risk not only for poor physical and mental health outcomes but also for impairments in future learning capacity and behavior. Here, we focus on recent evidence for a role of epigenetic DNA modifications as a potential mechanism that explains how early social life experiences become embedded in the circuitry of the developing brain and are associated with lifelong consequences.

During the 3rd day of length of stay (LOS), patients were asked if they suffered with sleep disorders. Patients reporting sleep disturbances during the first 3 days of LOS were included in the study. Patients were evaluated for insomnia, comorbidity, self-rated health, functional status, cognitive impairment and pain. Of the 280 subjects investigated, 80 referred sleep disorders during LOS with a prevalence of 36.7{\%}. Patients with sleep problems scored significantly worse on the cumulative index rating scale (CIRS) severity index (p=0.007), on the numeric rating scale (NRS) (p=0.01) and on the activities of daily living (ADL) scale (p{\textless}0.001). The CIRS severity index resulted the best predictor for insomnia related to hospitalization (OR 7.9, SE 0.85, p=0.01). The knowledge of insomnia predictors might help in planning preventive strategies to improve patients' global health status and quality of life.},

abstract = {In order to prevent sexual crimes, "sexual predator" laws now allow indefinite preventive civil commitment of criminals who have completed their prison sentences but are judged to have a paraphilic mental disorder that makes them likely to commit another crime. Such proceedings can bypass the usual protections of criminal law as long as the basis for incarceration is the attribution of a mental disorder. Thus, the difficult conceptual distinction between deviant sexual desires that are mental disorders versus those that are normal variations in sexual preference (even if they are eccentric, repugnant, or illegal if acted upon) has attained critical forensic significance. Yet, the concept of paraphilic disorders - called "perversions" in earlier times - is inherently fuzzy and controversial and thus open to conceptual abuse for social control purposes. Consequently, the criteria used in diagnosing paraphilic disorders deserve careful scrutiny. The DSM-5 sexual disorders work group is proposing substantial revisions to the paraphilia diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 nosology. It is claimed that the new criteria provide a reconceptualization that clarifies the distinction between normal variation and paraphilic disorder in a way relevant to forensic settings. In this article, after considering the logic of the concept of a paraphilic disorder, I examine each of the proposed changes to the DSM-5 paraphilia criteria and assess their conceptual validity. I argue that the DSM-5 proposals, while containing a kernel of an advance in distinguishing paraphilias from paraphilic disorders, nonetheless would yield criteria for paraphilic disorders that are conceptually invalid in ways open to serious forensic abuse.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sexual dimorphism in human brain structure is well recognised, but little is known about gender differences in white matter microstructure. We used diffusion tensor imaging to explore differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of microstructural integrity.

METHODS: A whole brain analysis of 135 matched subjects (90 men and 45 women) using a 1.5 T scanner. A region of interest (ROI) analysis was used to confirm those results where proximity to CSF raised the possibility of partial-volume artefact.

RESULTS: Men had higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in cerebellar white matter and in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus; women had higher FA in the corpus callosum, confirmed by ROI.

DISCUSSION: The size of the differences was substantial--of the same order as that attributed to some pathology--suggesting gender may be a potentially significant confound in unbalanced clinical studies. There are several previous reports of difference in the corpus callosum, though they disagree on the direction of difference; our findings in the cerebellum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus have not previously been noted. The higher FA in women may reflect greater efficiency of a smaller corpus callosum. The relatively increased superior longitudinal fasciculus and cerebellar FA in men may reflect their increased language lateralisation and enhanced motor development, respectively.},

abstract = {Previous research may have underestimated physicians' detection rates of alcohol dependence or abuse because case findings have been based on screening questionnaires instead of using in-depth diagnostic criteria and detection rates have been assessed by analyzing patient records instead of directly interviewing the physician. To test this hypothesis, consecutive patients of a general hospital (N=436) and of 12 randomly selected general practices (N=929) were examined. A two-step diagnostic procedure included screening questionnaires and a diagnostic interview (SCAN). The analysis compares detection rates based on methods used in previous studies to data using more precise methods. Physicians' detection rates ranged from 37.0{\%} to 88.9{\%} in the general hospital and from 11.1{\%} to 74.7{\%} in general practices depending on methods used. The physicians' detection rates could be improved by 10{\%} (general hospital) and 20{\%} (general practice) through the additional use of a screening questionnaire. Of those patients assessed by the physicians as problem drinkers in the general hospital, 13.9{\%} were referred to an addiction consultation-liaison service. Data reveal that physicians' abilities to detect problem drinkers have been underestimated. Routine screening procedures could play a major role in improving detection rates and reminding the physician to intervene.},

abstract = {The epidemiology of first-episode psychosis is poorly understood because of the paucity of systematic studies, yet it constitutes the fundamental basis for understanding the disorder and the foundations on which clinical, biological, therapeutic, and long-term outcome studies are built. A particular need is to clarify the diagnostic breadth of first-episode psychosis and, on this basis, to undertake systematic comparisons across representative populations of the psychoses, to include comparisons with first-episode mania. Considered here is the new generation of prospective studies that may be able to inform in some way on these issues. Attainment of the above goals requires prolonged accrual of "all" cases of nonaffective, affective, and any other psychotic illness, including first-episode mania, to derive the required representative populations. To illustrate some of the challenges, the structure of the Cavan-Monaghan prospective first episode study is described and its interim findings are outlined, as rural Ireland provides psychiatric care based on strict catchment areas and is characterized by substantive ethnic and socioeconomic homogeneity and stability. It is argued that there are 3 primary diagnostic nodes (schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder with psychotic features) around which there exist numerous additional, overlapping, and well-populated diagnostic categories that are distinct only in terms of their operational definition. Only through systematic, epidemiologically based studies that access this intrinsic diversity are we likely to understand fully the origins and pathobiology of first-episode psychosis.},

abstract = {Improved understanding of the pattern of white matter changes in early and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) states such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is necessary to support earlier preclinical detection of AD, and debate remains whether white matter changes in MCI are secondary to gray matter changes. We applied neuropsychologically based MCI criteria to a sample of normally aging older adults; 32 participants met criteria for MCI and 81 participants were classified as normal control (NC) subjects. Whole-head high resolution T1 and diffusion tensor imaging scans were completed. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was applied and a priori selected regions of interest were extracted. Hippocampal volume and cortical thickness averaged across regions with known vulnerability to AD were derived. Controlling for corticalthic kness, the MCI group showed decreased average fractional anisotropy (FA) and decreased FA in parietal white matter and in white matter underlying the entorhinal and posterior cingulate cortices relative to the NC group. Statistically controlling for cortical thickness, medial temporal FA was related to memory and parietal FA was related to executive functioning. These results provide further support for the potential role of white matter integrity as an early biomarker for individuals at risk for AD and highlight that changes in white matter may be independent of gray matter changes.},

We do not support the suggestion to move tic disorders to Anxiety and ObsessiveCompulsive Disorders, if the section Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence is not retained. Other than that, most proposed changes of the criteria for tic disorders contain a number of welcome improvements, e.g., the more unified definition of tics including the removal of the term stereotyped and the better capture of the temporal pattern of tics (e.g., removal of the maximum 3months criterion for a tic-free period in chronic tic disorders). But, unfortunately there are some inconsistencies in detail, e.g., the unification of diagnostic criteria for tic disorders had not been consistently pursued in transient tic disorder. In sum, the proposed DSM-5 criteria could be seen as an important step forward particularly in clinical routine. However, continued research is needed to justify the existing and proposed classification of tic disorders as well as to better clarify what other changes should be made in the DSM-5 and beyond.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is characterized by neuropsychological deficits across many cognitive domains. Cognitive phenotypes with high heritability and genetic overlap with schizophrenia liability can help elucidate the mechanisms leading from genes to psychopathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 170 published twin and family heritability studies of {\textgreater}800 000 nonpsychiatric and schizophrenia subjects to accurately estimate heritability across many neuropsychological tests and cognitive domains. The proportion of total variance of each phenotype due to additive genetic effects (A), shared environment (C), and unshared environment and error (E), was calculated by averaging A, C, and E estimates across studies and weighting by sample size. Heritability ranged across phenotypes, likely due to differences in genetic and environmental effects, with the highest heritability for General Cognitive Ability (32{\%}-67{\%}), Verbal Ability (43{\%}-72{\%}), Visuospatial Ability (20{\%}-80{\%}), and Attention/Processing Speed (28{\%}-74{\%}), while the lowest heritability was observed for Executive Function (20{\%}-40{\%}). These results confirm that many cognitive phenotypes are under strong genetic influences. Heritability estimates were comparable in nonpsychiatric and schizophrenia samples, suggesting that environmental factors and illness-related moderators (eg, medication) do not substantially decrease heritability in schizophrenia samples, and that genetic studies in schizophrenia samples are informative for elucidating the genetic basis of cognitive deficits. Substantial genetic overlap between cognitive phenotypes and schizophrenia liability (average rg = -.58) in twin studies supports partially shared genetic etiology. It will be important to conduct comparative studies in well-powered samples to determine whether the same or different genes and genetic variants influence cognition in schizophrenia patients and the general population.},

As a reference template, the widely used ICBM-152 was used. The atlas contains fiber orientation maps and hand-segmented white matter parcellation maps based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Registration accuracy by linear and non-linear transformation was measured, and automated template-based white matter parcellation was tested. The results showed a high correlation between the manual ROI-based and the automated approaches for normal adult populations.

The ultra high risk (UHR) concept remains a useful one. It identifies people with a significantly higher likelihood of developing a psychotic disorder (mostly schizophrenia) within a few years. From a research perspective it identifies a group worthy of study to increase our understanding of psychotic-like symptoms and their trajectories and the emerging phase of psychotic disorders. Until we have identified ed a group with much higher short term risk and developed effective and tolerable interventions, the costs of this new diagnosis outweigh the benefits. This should not preclude those help-seeking and symptomatic UHR individuals from getting the help they need. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {A large association study by O'Donovan et al recently suggested that genetic variation in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 increases the risk for developing schizophrenia. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are part of the family of glial growth factors; they control the growth and patterning of specific brain structures and regulate the maintenance and repair of neuronal tissues. In addition, a direct interaction was recently found between FGFRs and adenosine A(2A) receptors, leading to corticostriatal plasticity and antagonizing the signaling pathway of dopamine D(2) receptors. These findings make FGFs plausible candidate genes for schizophrenia. Here, we review the role of FGFs in schizophrenia and combine evidence from studies on variations in FGF genes, RNA expression, protein levels, and FGF administration, as well as the effects of medication and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. These data suggest that changes in the FGF system contribute to schizophrenia and possibly to a wider range of psychiatric disorders. The role of FGFs in schizophrenia and related disorders needs to be studied in more detail.},

Drawing on several sociological literatures (i.e. the diffusion of institutions, social stratification, and self-fulfilling dynamics), we argue that the current applications of IQ-reflective tests allow individuals with high IQ scores to receive greater access to developmental resources, enabling them to acquire additional capabilities over time, and ultimately perform their jobs better. This institutional explanation for the IQ-job performance link is an alternative to the prevailing assertion that IQ facilitates job performance through on-the-job learning. Further, this explanation suggests that the frequently repeated prescription "select on intelligence" may be institutionally contingent. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on our own and other empirical studies, we present here detailed clinical phenomenological descriptions of nonpsychotic anomalies of self-experience that may be observable in the prodromal phases of schizophrenia and in the schizotypal disorders. Anomalies of self-experience are grouped according the experiential domain that appears to be affected and are illustrated by short vignettes or verbatim quotes from the patients. It is suggested that disorders of the self deserve further systematic empirical investigations, also from an etiological perspective. Self-disorders may turn out to be potentially useful as a psychopathological organizer of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Psychopathological emphasis on these disorders may also help to integrate the search for the neurodevelopmental mechanisms in schizophrenia with developmental-psychological research on the ontogenesis of the self.},

For instance, severe cases astetraplegic or post-stroke patients are literally 'locked in' their bodies, unable to exert any motor control after a spinal cord injury or a brainstem stroke, requiring alternative methods of communication and control. However, in the near future, their brains may offer them a way out. EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is the technique utilized to measure brain activity and by the way that different brain signals are translated into commands that control an effector (e.g., controlling a spelling system  via  eye movements). Here,we aim to review the basic concepts of EEG-based BCI and the main advances in communication, in motor control restoration and in downregulation of cortical activitythat seem to be relevant for clinical applications in the coming years forneurorehabilitation of severely limited patients. It allows brain-derived communication in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor control restoration in patients after spinal cord injury and stroke. In addition, epilepsy and attention deficit and hyperactive disorder patients were able to downregulate their cortical activity. Owing to the rapid progression of EEG-based BCI research over the last few years and the swift ascent of computer processing speeds and signal analysis techniques, we suggest that emerging ideas related to clinical neurorehabilitation of severely limited patients will generate viable clinical applications in the near future.},

abstract = {Present neurobiological concepts of the mind-brain relationship often tend towards a reductionist view of subjectivity. In contrast to this, an ecological or systemic view of the brain is outlined which regards cognition and consciousness as components in a circular causality of organism and environment. In these cyclic processes, the brain functions as an organ of transformation which mutually translates elementary and complex system states into each other, thus allowing the organism to develop integral options of perception and action in its environment. Since these interactions, on their part, continuously change the microstructure of the brain, it has to be regarded as an organ that is formed biologically, socially as well as historically. The consequences of this ecological conception for our view of mental illness, for therapeutic approaches and for the role of subjectivity in psychiatry are pointed out.},

In 2005, the Kerr report concluded that fundamental changes were needed in our approach, shifting the emphasis from a reactive to a more proactive, prevention-based model in the treatment of acute medical conditions. We studied patients who had at least one alcohol- or drug-related emergency admission, whose most recent admission was to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and who, using the Scottish Patients at Risk of Re-admission and Admission (SPARRA) All Ages Tool, were thought to be at high risk of further emergency admission. We examined data sets derived from the National Health Service National Services Scotland Information Services Division, a Liaison Psychiatry database, data from the local psychiatric Patient Information Management System and data collected by the hospital alcohol liaison nurse to examine this group of patients further and consider the scope for any future intervention. Patients who have an alcohol- or drug-related emergency admission to the general hospital are at increased risk of re-admission. A substantial proportion of these patients has come into contact with the psychiatric services, often attracting a substance misuse and/or personality disorder diagnosis. A significant proportion also presents in the context of self-harm. In conclusion, this group of frequent hospital attenders may be difficult to engage but may benefit from more proactive intervention, a more joined-up management approach and the development of an enhanced general hospital alcohol liaison service.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dimensionality and the contribution of the proposed diagnostic criteria for the DSM-5 model of alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) which will provide guidelines for future diagnoses have not been examined in depth. METHOD: Data from past year drinkers in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), Wave 2 (n=22 177) were analysed. Severity and discrimination of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria was determined using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model. Comparative analyses were conducted on the DSM-IV criteria. Differential functioning of the criteria across a number of socio-demographic variables was assessed. RESULTS: The proposed criteria supported a unidimensional AUD model, with a factor loading range of 0.625-0.914 (craving=0.818). The model measured intermediate severity of AUDs with 'reduced time on important/pleasurable activities' and 'failure to meet major role obligations' criteria having the highest severity and discrimination. Craving, endorsed by 4.2{\{}{\%}{\}} of the general population, was in the mid-range for both severity (sixth) and discrimination (seventh). Significant measurement bias was found on four criteria across socio-demographic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the proposed DSM-5 changes yields an improved one-factor model of AUD over the existing DSM-IV model. Inclusion of a craving criterion improves the application of the diagnostic criteria in a general population sample, covering a previously unrepresented problem area. Additionally, criteria measuring the milder end of the AUD continuum remain absent and some criteria exhibit measurement non-invariance. The AUD classification may require further refinement to enhance validity and reliability.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Subthreshold psychosis-like experiences are typically the focus of psychosis-risk screening as they are associated with a greater propensity for future illness. Potentially prodromal individuals identified as being at clinical high-risk (CHR), however, report a variety of distressing and impairing mental health symptoms in addition to subthreshold psychosis symptoms, indicating that this population is of clinical interest regardless of whether or not they develop psychosis. In the current study, 90 young people (12–21) seeking mental health services completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2), a broad-range checklist of emotional and behavioral concerns and adaptive skills, followed by the Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes to assess psychosis risk. Those who met criteria for CHR (n=35) reported elevated scores across several BASC-2 scales including depression, attention problems, locus of control, and sense of inadequacy compared to help-seeking youth without CHR (n=55). Most of these scales were also elevated compared to general population norms. Further, the CHR group had significantly lower scores on two adaptive scales, self-reliance and relations with parents, indicating more impairment in these domains. Results indicate that young people at CHR experience more pervasive and/or more severe symptomatology across several domains of clinical significance compared to a similar group of help-seeking youth not at CHR. Results from this study aid in the understanding of symptom correlates of CHR status beyond attenuated symptoms that can provide clinical information relevant for treatment.},

abstract = {Cannabis use during adolescence increases the risk of developing psychotic disorders later in life. However, the neurobiological processes underlying this relationship are unknown. This review reports the results of a literature search comprising various neurobiological disciplines, ultimately converging into a model that might explain the neurobiology of cannabis-induced schizophrenia. The article briefly reviews current insights into brain development during adolescence. In particular, the role of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in experience-dependent maturation of specific cortical circuitries is examined. The review also covers recent hypotheses regarding disturbances in strengthening and pruning of synaptic connections in the prefrontal cortex, and the link with latent psychotic disorders. In the present model, cannabis-induced schizophrenia is considered to be a distortion of normal late postnatal brain maturation. Distortion of glutamatergic transmission during critical periods may disturb prefrontal neurocircuitry in specific brain areas. Our model postulates that adolescent exposure to $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive substance in cannabis, transiently disturbs physiological control of the endogenous cannabinoid system over glutamate and GABA release. As a result, THC may adversely affect adolescent experience-dependent maturation of neural circuitries within prefrontal cortical areas. Depending on dose, exact time window and duration of exposure, this may ultimately lead to the development of psychosis or schizophrenia. The proposed model provides testable hypotheses which can be addressed in future studies, including animal experiments, reanalysis of existing epidemiological data, and prospective epidemiological studies in which the role of the dose-time-effect relationship should be central.},

His remarks have proven a useful goad to the field, focusing attention on the importance of an ethics framework for forensic practice. But Stone remains dubious that any system of ethics--including the "Standard Position" on which he focuses his critique--could be of much value in practice. In contrast, I suggest that Stone's pessimism is not well founded. Immanent in forensic practice itself is a reasonable set of ethics principles, based on truth-telling and respect for persons. Psychiatrists can offer reliable and valid testimony, while resisting seduction into an advocacy role. Indeed, with new structured approaches to assessment, the potential utility of forensic testimony is probably greater than ever. Though problematic behavior still exists, forensic psychiatry offers the factual background and interpretive context to allow legal decision-makers to make better choices than they otherwise would.},

This claim misses the distinction between the phenomenological subjective mental content of an experience and the physical-neuronal configuration that elicits the experience; also, it cannot explain the experimentally observed discrepancy, between subjective timing and the empirically delayed time for cerebral adequacy for eliciting the experience, found when stimulating a subcortical sensory pathway. Honderich usefully distinguishes between our stated (delay-and-antedating) hypothesis and a different though unacceptable one which would have serious implications for mind-brain theories. The delay-and-antedating hypothesis does not provide a formally definitive contradiction of monist-identity theory (of the mind-brain relationship). However, our experimentally based hypothesis does dissociate subjective/mental timing from the actual physical/neuronal time of an experience. This phenomenon, though conceptually strange, must be encompassed by any mind-brain theory.},

abstract = {We review the history of bipolar disorders from the classical Greek period to DSM-IV. Perhaps the first person who described mania and melancholia as two different phenomenological states of one and the same disease was the Greek physician of the 1st century AD, Aretaeus of Cappadocia. The modern concept of bipolar disorders was born in France, with the publications of Falret (1851) and Baillarger (1854). Emil Kraepelin, however, in 1899, unified all types of affective disorders in ‘manic-depressive insanity'; in spite of some opposition, Kraepelin's unitary concept was adopted worldwide. In the 1960s, however, the rebirth of bipolar disorders took place through the publications of Jules Angst, Carlo Perris, and George Winokur, who independently showed that there exist clinical, familial and course characteristics validating the distinction between unipolar and bipolar disorders; in addition, they verified several of the corresponding opinions of the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard school. The concept of unipolar and bipolar disorders has further advanced in the last three decades: landmark developments include the renaissance of Kraepelin's mixed states and of Kahlbaum's and Hecker's cyclothymia and related affective temperaments, the concept of soft bipolar spectrum (Akiskal), and the distinction of schizoaffective disorders into unipolar and bipolar forms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to determine whether patients with schizophrenia differ from comparison subjects in regional brain volumes and whether these differences are similar in male and female subjects. METHOD: They conducted a systematic search for structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of patients with schizophrenia that reported volume measurements of selected cortical, subcortical, and ventricular regions in relation to comparison groups. They carried out a meta-analysis of the volumes of these regions in the patients with schizophrenia and the comparison subjects using a random effects model; they also used random effects regression analysis to examine the influence of gender on effect sizes. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were identified as suitable for analysis; these studies included 1,588 independent patients with schizophrenia. Assuming a volume of 100{\%} in the comparison group, they found that the mean cerebral volume of the subjects with schizophrenia was smaller (98{\%}), but the mean total ventricular volume of the subjects with schizophrenia was greater (126{\%}). Relative to the cerebral volume differences, the regional volumes of the subjects with schizophrenia were 94{\%} in the left and right amygdala, 94{\%} in the left and 95{\%} in the right hippocampus/amygdala, and 93{\%} in the left and 95{\%} in the right parahippocampus. Relative to the global ventricular system differences, the largest differences in ventricular subdivisions were in the right and left body of the lateral ventricle, where the volumes of schizophrenic subjects were 116{\%} and 116{\%}, respectively. For most regions, effect size was not significantly related to gender. CONCLUSIONS: Regional structural differences in patients with schizophrenia include bilaterally reduced volume of medial temporal lobe structures. There is a need for greater integration of results from structural MRI studies to avoid redundant research activity.},

A substantial number of individuals seek services not through specialty psychiatric clinics but through primary care. Thus, the interface between psychiatry and the rest of medicine represents an appropriate area of focus in which to improve the detection and treatment of mental disorders. Development of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) can play a key role in this process. DSM-5 is expected to include specific revisions in diagnostic criteria, chapter organization, text structure, and classification approach that are designed to improve use of DSM by nonpsychiatrist physicians. Furthermore, revisions to DSM-5 will inform development of the primary care version of DSM-5. The goal is to publish a manual that enhances clinical utility in a manner that is concise and more amenable to use in primary care.},

abstract = {Development of depression is associated with the body's response to prolonged stress, which adversely affects the functioning of the nervous, endocrine and immune systems. Prolonged stress can lead to the development of a so-called allostatic load and reduction of concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These changes result in impairment of neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling process. This article illustrates the involvement of key mediators of allostasis such as the neuroendocrine and immune systems, in the pathogenesis of depression. The literature concerning the contribution of the neuroendocrine and immune systems to depression incidence was reviewed. Development of depression is associated with disturbance of the body's allostasis and inflammatory activation of the immune system. It leads to a chronic increase in the concentration of cortisol and proinflammatory cytokines, which results in an allostatic load. This load leads to neurodegeneration, eventually causing irreversible cognitive impairment and permanent disability. Determination of the concentration of chemokines and their receptors is an important indicator of activation of the immune and neuroendocrine systems. The activity of these systems reflects the severity of the disease and provides important information for effective antidepressant treatment.},

abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In view of the growing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide, there is an urgent need for the development of better diagnostic tools and more effective therapeutic interventions. At the earliest stages of AD, no significant cognitive or functional impairment is detected by conventional clinical methods. However, new technologies based on structural and functional neuroimaging, and on the biochemical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reveal correlates of intracerebral pathology in individuals with mild, predementia symptoms. These putative correlates are commonly referred to as AD-related biomarkers. The relevance of the early diagnosis of AD relies on the hypothesis that pharmacological interventions with disease-modifying compounds are likely to produce clinically relevant benefits if started early enough in the continuum towards dementia. Here we review the clinical characteristics of the prodromal and transitional states from normal cognitive ageing to dementia in AD. We further address recent developments in biomarker research to support the early diagnosis and prediction of dementia, and point out the challenges and perspectives for the translation of research data into clinical practice.},

To test this hypothesis, we assessed participants' emotional experiences using a 7-day experience-sampling protocol. Depression was assessed using structured clinical interviews and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. As predicted, individuals with MDD had less differentiated emotional experiences than did healthy participants, but only for negative emotions. These differences were above and beyond the effects of emotional intensity and variability.},

Yet, the precise nature of the attentional deficits in schizophrenia remains poorly understood. Translating advances in cognitive psychology to clinical research brings paradigms with greater analytic power to the study of attention in schizophrenia. In particular, these paradigms should shed light on whether the attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia is best conceptualized as arising from limitations in amount or allocation of processing capacity or from more specific structural bottlenecks that do not allow certain processes to be carried out in two tasks simultaneously. Certain types of dual-task paradigms are particularly well suited to make distinctive predictions, particularly those involving a psychological refractory period paradigm. The background and design of a series of ongoing studies of prodromal, first-episode, and chronic schizophrenia patients are described that are addressing the developmental course of attentional dysfunction in this disorder. These refined paradigms should substantially increase our understanding of the specific forms of attentional impairment characterizing schizophrenia and their connections to symptom development and functional outcome.},

Moreover, these methods have each appeared in isolation, so a unified framework that integrates the existing methods, as well as new multilevel mediation models, is lacking. Here we show that a multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) paradigm can overcome these 2 limitations of mediation analysis with MLM. We present an integrative 2-level MSEM mathematical framework that subsumes new and existing multilevel mediation approaches as special cases. We use several applied examples and accompanying software code to illustrate the flexibility of this framework and to show that different substantive conclusions can be drawn using MSEM versus MLM.},

abstract = {This article illustrates the timeline of the development of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The term "evidence-based medicine" is relatively new. In fact, as far as we can tell, investigators from McMaster's University began using the term during the 1990s. EBM was defined as "a systemic approach to analyze published research as the basis of clinical decision making." Then in 1996, the term was more formally defined by Sacket et al., who stated that EBM was "the conscientious and judicious use of current best evidence from clinical care research in the management of individual patients." Ancient era EBM consists of ancient historical or anecdotal accounts of what may be loosely termed EBM. This was followed by the development of the renaissance era of EBM, which began roughly during the seventeenth century. During this era personal journals were kept and textbooks began to become more prominent. This was followed by the 1900s, during an era we term the transitional era of EBM (1900-1970s). Knowledge during this era could be shared more easily in textbooks and eventually peer-reviewed journals. Finally, during the 1970s we enter the modern era of EBM. Technology has had a large role in the advancement of EBM. Computers and database software have allowed compilation of large amounts of data. The Index Medicus has become a medical dinosaur of the past that students of today likely do not recognize. The Internet has also allowed incredible access to masses of data and information. However, we must be careful with an overabundance of "unfiltered" data. As history, as clearly shown us, evidence and data do not immediately translate into evidence based practice.},

abstract = {We present a technique for automatically assigning a neuroanatomical label to each voxel in an MRI volume based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. In contrast to existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue classes, the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel, including left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, lateral ventricles, hippocampus, and amygdala. The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling, and of sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect changes in the volume of noncortical structures that presage the onset of probable Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The multiple risk factors for major depression are interrelated through poorly understood developmental pathways. In 2002, the authors presented a developmental model for major depression in women. Based on similar methods, they here present an analogous model for men. METHOD: Using data from 2,935 adult male twins, interviewed twice over a 2-4-year period, the authors constructed, by means of structural equation modeling, an integrated etiologic model for major depression that predicts depressive episodes over 1 year from 18 risk factors conceptualized as five developmental "tiers" reflecting childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence, adulthood, and the last year. RESULTS: The best-fitting model, including six correlations and 76 paths, provided a good fit to the data, explaining 49{\%} of the variance in the liability to depressive episodes. The overall results, similar to those seen in women, suggest that the development of major depression results from the action and interaction of three broad pathways of internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and adversity. Childhood parental loss and low self-esteem were more potent variables in the model in men than in women. Genetic risks for major depression had a broader spectrum of action in men than in women. The pathway to major depression through externalizing symptoms was not more prominent in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: Major depression in men, as in women, is an etiologically complex disorder influenced by risk factors from multiple domains that act in developmental time. The similarities in etiologic pathways to major depression for men and women outweigh the modest differences.},

abstract = {Using olfactory molecular specificity, we examined the inheritance of parental traumatic exposure, a phenomenon that has been frequently observed, but not understood. We subjected F0 mice to odor fear conditioning before conception and found that subsequently conceived F1 and F2 generations had an increased behavioral sensitivity to the F0-conditioned odor, but not to other odors. When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm DNA from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed CpG hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes. Our findings provide a framework for addressing how environmental information may be inherited transgenerationally at behavioral, neuroanatomical and epigenetic levels.},

Some features of the process, such as problem definition and construct validation, are similar to hypothesis-testing research. Others, such as within-case analysis and replication logic, are unique to the inductive, case-oriented process. Overall, the process described here is highly iterative and tightly linked to data. This research approach is especially appropriate in new topic areas. The resultant theory is often novel, testable, and empirically valid. Finally, framebreaking insights, the tests of good theory (e.g., parsimony, logical coherence), and convincing grounding in the evidence are the key criteria for evaluating this type of research.},

abstract = {Our objective was to develop a diffusion tensor MR imaging pulse sequence that allows whole brain coverage with isotropic resolution within a clinically acceptable time. A single-shot, cardiac-gated MR pulse sequence, optimized for measuring the diffusion tensor in human brain, was developed to provide whole-brain coverage with isotropic (2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm) spatial resolution, within a total imaging time of approximately 15 min. The diffusion tensor was computed for each voxel in the whole volume and the data processed for visualization in three orthogonal planes. Anisotropy data were further visualized using a maximum-intensity projection algorithm. Finally, reconstruction of fiber-tract trajectories i.e., "tractography" was performed. Images obtained with this pulse sequence provide clear delineation of individual white matter tracts, from the most superior cortical regions down to the cerebellum and brain stem. Because the data are acquired with isotropic resolution, they can be reformatted in any plane and the sequence can therefore be used, in general, for macroscopic neurological or psychiatric neuroimaging investigations. The 3D visualization afforded by maximum intensity projection imaging and tractography provided easy visualization of individual white matter fasciculi, which may be important sites of neuropathological degeneration or abnormal brain development. This study has shown that it is possible to obtain robust, high quality diffusion tensor MR data at 1.5 Tesla with isotropic resolution (2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm) from the whole brain within a sufficiently short imaging time that it may be incorporated into clinical imaging protocols.},

A growing body of data indicates that the glutamatergic system, in particular, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype receptor, plays a major role in neuronal plasticity, cognition and memory and may underlie the pathophysiology of multiple psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we review the literature regarding BPD and its cognitive deficits and the current data on glutamatergic and NMDA neurotransmission. We propose that multiple cognitive dysfunctions and symptoms presented by BPD patients, like dissociation, psychosis and impaired nociception, may result from the dysregulation of the NMDA neurotransmission. This impairment may be the result of a combination of biological vulnerability and environmental influences mediated by the NMDA neurotransmission.},

abstract = {Background: Several self-report instruments were developed to capture psychotic prodrome, and were claimed to have good predictive validity. The feasibility of screening is questionable considering the heterogeneity of the targeted populations and the negative ramifications of false positive identification. This study developed a questionnaire using data covering a wide range of clinical characteristics. Methods: One hundred and eleven putative pre-psychotic participants, 129 normal comparison subjects, and 95 non-psychotic psychiatric outpatients completed a 231-item questionnaire comprising a 110-item Wisconsin psychotic prone scale, 74-item schizotypal personality questionnaire, 33-item basic symptoms, and 14-item cognitive symptoms. Items showing the best discriminating power, estimated using chi-square statistics with Bonferroni correction, were extracted to create a brief version. A two-stage cut-off approach emphasizing specific items was applied to maximize sensitivity and specificity. The concurrent validity of the proposed approach was estimated using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure. Results: A 15-item self-report questionnaire was developed. Respondents checking at least eight items, or those checking three to seven items including any of the three referring to feeling stress in crowds, aloofness, and perceptual disturbance, would be considered putatively pre-psychotic with the largest sensitivity. +. specificity (0.784. +. 0.705 = 1.489). This cut-off selection was the best estimate by calculating 1000 permutations in the cross-validation procedure. Conclusions: This investigation proposes a different orientation for applying questionnaires to screen putative pre-psychotic states, with less emphasis on attenuated psychotic symptoms and predictive values. Besides providing a handy tool for increasing awareness and referral, the instructions of such a screening questionnaire should be carefully worded. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder in 2005, with a 2007 update. This second update, in conjunction with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD), reviews new evidence and is designed to be used in conjunction with the previous publications. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain mostly unchanged. Lithium, valproate, and several atypical antipsychotics continue to be first-line treatments for acute mania. Tamoxifen is now suggested as a third-line augmentation option. The combination of olanzapine and carbamazepine is not recommended. For the management of bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine monotherapy, olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion remain first-line options. New data support the use of adjunctive modafinil as a second-line option, but also indicate that aripiprazole should not be used as monotherapy for bipolar depression. Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, and olanzapine continue to be first-line options for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. New data support the use of quetiapine monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for the prevention of manic and depressive events, aripiprazole monotherapy for the prevention of manic events, and risperidone long-acting injection monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, and adjunctive ziprasidone for the prevention of mood events. Bipolar II disorder is frequently overlooked in treatment guidelines, but has an important clinical impact on patients' lives. This update provides an expanded look at bipolar II disorder.},

The present paper conducted a meta-analysis of the longitudinal studies that have investigated intelligence as a predictor of success (as measured by education, occupation, and income). In order to better evaluate the predictive power of intelligence, the paper also includes meta-analyses of parental socioeconomic status (SES) and academic performance (school grades) as predictors of success. The results demonstrate that intelligence is a powerful predictor of success but, on the whole, not an overwhelmingly better predictor than parental SES or grades. Moderator analyses showed that the relationship between intelligence and success is dependent on the age of the sample but there is little evidence of any historical trend in the relationship. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Neurocognitive impairment predicts disability in schizophrenia, making intervention theoretically attractive as a means to minimise chronic disability. Many trials confirm that cognitive remediation (CR) produces meaningful, durable improvements in cognition and functioning but fewer focus on the early stages. We systematically reviewed CR trials in early schizophrenia to determine its efficacy on global cognition, functioning and symptoms.Two reviewers independently searched electronic databases to identify randomised controlled trials investigating CR following a first episode of psychosis. Eleven trials with 615 participants were identified.Random effect models revealed a non-significant effect of CR on global cognition (effect size = 0.13, 95{\%} CI - 0.04, 0.31; p0.14), p {\textless} 0.05 in sensitivity analysis (effect size 0.19; CI 0.00, 0.38). One of seven neurocognitive domains showed a significant positive effect (verbal learning and memory) and five others showed borderline significant benefits. There was a significant effect on functioning (0.18; CI 0.01, 0.36; p {\textless} 0.05) and symptoms (0.19; CI 0.02, 0.36; p. {\textless}. 0.05). CR's effect on functioning and symptoms was larger in trials with adjunctive psychiatric rehabilitation and small group interventions.CR's effect sizes in early illness were smaller than those in chronic schizophrenia, perhaps because of participants' reduced scope for improvement, though trials' small number and size produces uncertain estimates of effect. However, significant benefits were seen in functioning and symptoms and moderator analyses indicate factors that may increase CR's effect. Findings here, theoretical considerations and trials in chronic schizophrenia suggest that targeting social cognition might also enhance its efficacy.},

To this aim, firstly we trace a theoretical distinction among private, prospective, and communicative intentions. Second, we propose a set of predictions concerning the recognition of these three types of intention in healthy individuals, and we report the experimental results corroborating our theoretical model of intention. Third, we derive from our model predictions relevant for the domain of psychopathological functioning. In particular, we treat the cases of both hyper-intentionality (as in paranoid schizophrenia) and hypo-intentionality (as in autistic spectrum disorders). Our conclusion is that the theoretical model of intention we propose contributes to enlarge our knowledge on the neurobiological bases of intention processing, in both healthy people and in people with impairments to the neurocognitive system that underlies intention recognition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not well-established whether excess mortality associated with depression is higher in men than in women.

METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies in which depression was measured at baseline, where mortality rates were reported at follow-up, and in which separate mortality rates for men and women were reported. We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical databases and calculated relative risks of excess mortality in men and women.

RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. Among the people with depression, excess mortality in men was higher than in women (RR=1.97; 1.63-2.37). Compared with non-depressed participants, excess mortality was increased in depressed women (RR=1.55; 95{\%} CI: 1.32-1.82), but not as much as in men (RR=2.04; 95{\%} CI: 1.76-2.37), and the difference between excess mortality in men was significantly higher than in women (p{\textless}0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Excess mortality related to depression is higher in men than in women. Although the exact mechanisms for this difference are not clear, it may point at differential or more intensified pathways leading from depression to increased mortality in depressed men compared to women.},

abstract = {Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Should Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms. Depression and Anxiety, 2011. 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The boundaries of bipolarity have been expanding over the past decade. Using a well characterized epidemiologic cohort, in this paper our objectives were: (1). to test the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV hypomania, (2). to develop and validate criteria for the definition of softer expressions of bipolar-II (BP-II) disorder and hypomania, (3). to demonstrate the prevalence, clinical validity and comorbidity of the entire soft bipolar spectrum. METHODS: Data on the continuum from normal to pathological mood and overactivity, collected from a 20-year prospective community cohort study of young adults, were used. Clinical validity was analysed by family history, course and clinical characteristics, including the association with depression and substance abuse. RESULTS: (1). Just as euphoria and irritability, symptoms of overactivity should be included in the stem criterion of hypomania; episode length should probably not be a criterion for defining hypomania as long as three of seven signs and symptoms are present, and a change in functioning should remain obligatory for a rigorous diagnosis. (2). Below that threshold, 'hypomanic symptoms only' associated with major or mild depression are important indicators of bipolarity. (3). A broad definition of bipolar-II disorder gives a cumulative prevalence rate of 10.9{\{}{\%}{\}}, compared to 11.4{\{}{\%}{\}} for broadly defined major depression. A special group of minor bipolar disorder (prevalence 9.4{\{}{\%}{\}}) was identified, of whom 2.0{\{}{\%}{\}} were cyclothymic; pure hypomania occurred in 3.3{\{}{\%}{\}}. The total prevalence of the soft bipolar spectrum was 23.7{\{}{\%}{\}}, comparable to that (24.6{\{}{\%}{\}}) for the entire depressive spectrum (including dysthymia, minor and recurrent brief depression). LIMITATION: A national cohort with a larger number of subjects is needed to verify the numerical composition of the softest bipolar subgroups proposed herein. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic criteria of hypomania need revision. On the basis of its demonstrated clinical validity, a broader concept of soft bipolarity is proposed, of which nearly 11{\{}{\%}{\}} constitutes the spectrum of bipolar disorders proper, and another 13{\{}{\%}{\}} probably represent the softest expression of bipolarity intermediate between bipolar disorder and normality.},

abstract = {Background Despite knowledge of amygdala involvement in fear and anxiety, its contribution to the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remains controversial. In the context of neuroimaging studies, it seems likely that the heterogeneity of the disorder might have contributed to a lack of consistent findings. Aims To assess the influence of OCD symptom dimensions on amygdala responses to a well-validated emotional face-matching paradigm. Method Cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 67 patients with OCD and 67 age-, gender- and education-level matched healthy controls. Results The severity of aggression/checking and sexual/religious symptom dimensions were significantly associated with heightened amygdala activation in those with OCD when responding to fearful faces, whereas no such correlations were seen for other symptom dimensions. Conclusions Amygdala functional alterations in OCD appear to be specifically modulated by symptom dimensions whose origins may be more closely linked to putative amygdala-centric processes, such as abnormal fear processing.},

A hypothesis that untreated psychosis is neurotoxic has been postulated, but the mechanisms of that toxicity have not been described. We re-analyzed papers collected for a systematic review to extract data on the hypotheses that have been generated on the potential mechanisms by which DUP could impact brain morphology in first-episode psychosis. Dopaminergic hyperactivity, prolonged hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation, and persistent activity of catecholamines have been hypothesized as mechanisms to explain these associations. However, the question remains as to whether the observed structural changes are permanent or may be reversed via antipsychotic treatment.},

It will be of interest to both mental health professionals and to philosophers interested in classification in science. The D.S.M. has become extremely controversial, and the possibility that there may be philosophical difficulties with it has become a commonplace in the mental health literature. Classifying Madness offers mental health professionals an opportunity to explore suspicions that there might be conceptual problems with the D.S.M. For philosophers, this book aims to contribute to debates in the philosophy of science concerning natural kinds, the theory-ladenness of classification, and the effect of sociological factors in science. These issues are normally approached via a consideration of the natural sciences and, as will be seen, approaching them via a consideration of psychiatry helps shed new light on old problems.},

Several studies have used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate these changes, but a consensus has not yet emerged on which white matter tracts undergo changes in the later stages of development or what the most important driving factors are behind these changes. In this study of typically developing 8- to 16-year-old children, we use a comprehensive data-driven approach based on principal components analysis to identify effects of age, gender, and brain volume on dMRI parameters, as well as their relative importance. We also show that secondary components of these parameters predict full-scale IQ, independently of the age- and gender-related effects. This overarching assessment of the common factors and gender differences in normal white matter tract development will help to advance understanding of this process in late childhood and adolescence.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review the literature evaluating outcomes resulting from expansion of the bipolar disorder (BD) diagnostic category. We were particularly interested in identifying high-level evidence for improved clinical outcomes as documented by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies. METHODS: The English-language literature was searched using Ovid MEDLINE for studies of BD referenced against the key word spectrum. We used bibliographies and other databases to extend this search when no relevant RCTs or relevant cohort studies were identified. RESULTS: In the MEDLINE searches, abstracts and titles of 86 studies were examined and 48 were found to be related to the topic of bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD). No RCTs or prospective cohort studies evaluating modified diagnostic or therapeutic practices were identified. The literature about the BSD consists mostly of expert opinion emphasizing: various links between bipolar and unipolar mood disorders; a proposal that a greater proportion of the population without a mood disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders should be diagnosed under the BD category; and, proposals that syndromes currently classified elsewhere should be subsumed under the BD category. CONCLUSIONS: Our search failed to uncover high-level evidence demonstrating the clinical utility of proposed diagnostic realignments. The widespread acceptance of the expanded spectrum concept appears to be based on interpretation of descriptive epidemiologic data by high-profile experts.},

abstract = {A psychoactive substance use disorder (ICD-10) was diagnosed in 28{\%} of 1222 psychiatric referrals in six general hospitals in Finland. In the age group 35 o 50 years, 53{\%} of men and 29{\%} of women had a substance use disorder. In the age group 35 to 50 years, sociodemographic characteristics differentiated men diagnosed with substance use disorders from other male consultation patients, but women with substance use disorders were similar to other female consultation patients. Urgency (i.e., consultation required within the same day) was accentuated in referrals associated with substance use disorders. Of attempted suicides, 65{\%} were related to substance use disorders. Use of sedatives or hypnotics had more frequently induced disorders in women with substance use diagnosis compared to men with diagnosis (30{\%} vs. 13{\%}; p {\textless} 0.01). Female consultation patients with substance use disorders more often than respective male patients were current mental health outpatients. In conclusion, the proportion of substance use disorders among psychiatric consultation patients was remarkably higher in the present study (28{\%}) compared with the average provided by the earlier literature (12{\%}), and therefore, at least in Finland, psychiatric assessment of general hospital patients should always include assessment for the presence of substance use disorders. If substance use is only looked for in patients who have social problems typical of advanced misuse, detecting female substance use might be impeded. Relation of attempted suicides to substance use disorders was confirmed. To prevent misuse of prescribed drugs detected particularly in female consultation patients, and to prevent attempted suicides, doctors' attention is called to prescriptions of sedatives and hypnotics.},

abstract = {The salience hypothesis of psychosis rests on a simple but profound observation that subtle alterations in the way that we perceive and experience stimuli have important consequences for how important these stimuli become for us, how much they draw our attention, how they embed themselves in our memory and, ultimately, how they shape our beliefs. We put forward the idea that a classical memory illusion - the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) effect - offers a useful way of exploring processes related to such aberrant belief formation. The illusion occurs when, as a consequence of its relationship to previous stimuli, a stimulus that has not previously been presented is falsely remembered. Such illusory familiarity is thought to be generated by the surprising fluency with which the stimulus is processed. In this respect, the illusion relates directly to the salience hypothesis and may share common cognitive underpinnings with aberrations of perception and attribution that are found in psychosis. In this paper, we explore the theoretical importance of this experimentally-induced illusion in relation to the salience model of psychosis. We present data showing that, in healthy volunteers, the illusion relates directly to self reported anomalies of experience and magical thinking. We discuss this finding in terms of the salience hypothesis and of a broader Bayesian framework of perception and cognition which emphasizes the salience both of predictable and unpredictable experiences.},

abstract = {The mental health status of persons with Jewish background living in Germany is discussed with special regard to social exclusion like anti-Semitism and overprotective parental rearing behavior, as a transmissional factor of the KZ-Syndrome. These stressors are considered in the context of a higher risk for depression/fear and psychosomatic disorders and also abnormal cortisol levels. The present sample (N=89) is derived from the Jewish population currently living in the German region of Saxony aged between 17-36 years that emigrated from the post-Soviet-Union areas. The mean age was 22.9 years. Two questionnaires to detect psychosomatic symptoms (Giessen complaint list (GBB)-24, hospital anxiety and depression scale) and one questionnaire addressing parental rearing behavior (FEE) were employed. Comparisons were drawn with normative data from the literature about the German residential population. In addition, questions were asked concerning the experience of anti-Semitism in Germany and in the post-Soviet-Union areas. A higher prevalence of depression/fear (10.3{\%} versus 18.2{\%}) and psychosomatic symptoms (M=14.03 versus 17.8; t=2.42; P{\textless}0.05) was observed in Jewish migrants to Germany as compared with non-Jewish German residents. Furthermore, anti-Semitic experiences in Germany correlated positively with depression (r=0.293; P{\textless}0.01) and fear (r=0.254; P{\textless}0.05). The anti-Semitic experiences in the post-Soviet-Union areas also correlated positively with limb pain (r=0.41, P{\textless}0.01), fatigue symptoms (r=0.296, P{\textless}0.01) and psychocardial symptoms (r=0.219, P{\textless}0.05). It was also confirmed that the male respondents recalled a controlling and overprotecting maternal rearing behavior more frequently than the German standard random sample (M=15.39 versus 18.6; t=2.68; P{\textless}0.01). The latter also correlated significantly positive with epigastric pain (r=0.349; P{\textless}0.01). The present results show that depression, fear and psychosomatic problems are common in Jewish residents with a background of migration from the post-Soviet-Union areas to Germany. Apart from the transgenerational passing of psychological traumata and the Holocaust experiences, other stressors like anti-Semitism, control and overprotection as parental rearing measures appear to be important factors specifically contributing to the pathogenesis of the attributed symptoms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD) often co-occur and share a broad range of risk factors. The goal of this study was to examine whether the co-occurrence of anxiety disorders and MDD could be explained by an underlying latent factor and whether the risk factors exert their effect exclusively through this factor, directly on each disorder, or through a combination of effects at both levels. METHODS: Data were drawn from a large, nationally representative sample. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify the latent structure of anxiety disorders. A multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) approach was used to assess the common and specific effects of risk factors for anxiety disorders. RESULTS: A one-factor model provided a good fit to the co-occurrence of anxiety disorders. Low self-esteem, family history of depression, female sex, childhood sexual abuse, White race, years of education, number of traumatic experiences, and disturbed family environment increased the risk of anxiety disorders and MDD through their effect on the latent factor. There were also several direct effects of the covariates on the disorders, indicating that the effect of the covariates differed across disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Risk for anxiety disorders and MDD appears to be mediated partially by a latent variable underlying anxiety disorders and MDD, and partially by disorder-specific effects. These findings may contribute to account for the high rates of comorbidity among disorders, identify commonalities in the etiologies of these disorders, and provide clues for the development of unified preventive interventions.},

abstract = {The historical roots of dementia praecox and schizophrenia are described in the context of current nosology and continuing controversies surrounding this nosology. Relevant books and journal articles were reviewed. The information was obtained through computer searches and cross-references from previously published papers. If English translations of foreign language articles were available, they were used; if not, the cross-references were consulted. The psychoses have existed as diagnostic categories from ancient times although their names have changed. Initially, these disorders were considered diseases of the brain, a concept that was swept aside in the United States, influenced by European-derived psychodynamic theories. American clinicians and investigators simply accepted these theories, showing little interest in testing their underlying principles. In contrast, a narrower Kraepelinian approach was adopted outside the United States, and attempts were made to refine its nosology. Because current data supports a central nervous system aetiology for schizophrenia, the concept of dementia praecox warrants resurrection. The authors suggest abandoning the term schizophrenia in favour of the more broad and generic term dementia praecox. Replacing 'schizophrenia' with 'dementia praecox' in the 21st century will facilitate further research and help clarify the nosology of various brain disorders currently included in the schizophrenias.},

abstract = {The revised dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates that dopamine metabolism is impacted differently with increased dopamine in the subcortical mesolimbic system and decreased dopamine in prefrontal cortical regions. Recently, we described findings supporting this hypothesis using a financial reward task in patients with schizophrenia (Walter et al., 2009). In addition to analysing prediction and prediction error coding, we found in this study evidence for aberrant cortical representation of salience in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in patients. Here, we reanalysed data of four other published reward studies of our group in order to investigate (i) whether we could replicate this finding in an independent cohort of patients with schizophrenia and (ii) how dopaminergic modulation impacts on cortical salience representation. Our main result was that we could replicate the finding of aberrant salience coding in the right VLPFC in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we found evidence that the degree of salience coding in this region was correlated inversely with negative symptoms (anhedonia). Results of dopaminergic modulation showed tentative evidence for an influence of dopaminergic stimulation, but were not conclusive. In summary, we conclude that the right VLPFC might play a crucial role in salience coding and is impaired in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The vulnerability and hybrid models for the onset of psychosis are presented. Familial liability, perinatal and developmental factors, and decreased cognitive performance associate with psychosis in adolescence and young adulthood. Genetic predisposition connected with behavioural deviances and/or mental symptoms associate with psychotic development so strongly that monitoring and intervention are indicated. Especially, in families where one or both parents or other family members are severely mentally ill, early family-centred assessments and interventions is needed. Together with familial psychosis, deficits in adolescent and young adult social development indicate thorough assessment, intensive monitoring and often also preventive interventions. During the prodromal phase of psychosis, patients often display unspecific symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, personality disorders, abuse of alcohol or drugs. Social decline, possibly associated with neurocognitive deficits, frequently occurs in the prodromal phase or in the early course of schizophrenia. Among help-seeking patients, occurrence of the Basic Symptoms represent the early initial prodromal state, while the late initial prodome state includes attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, and a first degree relative with psychotic disorder, or a schizotypal personality disorder, together with decrease global functioning. These patients suffer also from other mental symptoms and functional decline, and are clearly in need of psychiatric assessment and treatment. Intervention trials have shown that patients suffering from prodromal syndromes can be successfully treated, and onset of psychosis prevented or delayed. However, more large-scale studies and clinical case descriptions of treatment of patients with sub-threshold psychotic symptoms are needed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The creation of each edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of psychiatry has proven enormously controversial. The current effort to revise the 'bible' of disorder definitions for the field of mental health is no exception. The controversy around DSM-5 reached a crescendo with the announcement from National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that the institute would focus efforts on the development of their own psychiatric nosology, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) (NIMH, 2013). DISCUSSION: The RDoC seem to be structured around the concern that the only way to find objectivity in the classification of diseases or disorders in psychiatry is to begin with biology and work back to symptoms. Values infuse medical categories in various ways and drive practical considerations about where and how to divide up constellations of already agreed upon symptoms. SUMMARY: We briefly argue that all nosologies are infused with values and, while we should continue to sharpen the psychiatric nosology, normativity will permeate even the strictest biologically based taxonomy; this need not be a bad thing.},

abstract = {Despite advances in the treatment of schizophrenia over the past half-century, the illness is frequently associated with a poor outcome. This is principally related to the late identification and intervention in the course of the illness by which time patients have experienced a substantial amount of socio-occupational decline that can be difficult to reverse. The emphasis has therefore shifted to defining psychosis-risk syndromes and evaluating treatments that can prevent transition to psychosis in these ultra-high risk groups. To consider the appropriateness of adding psychosis risk syndrome to our diagnostic nomenclature, the psychotic disorders work group extensively reviewed all available data, consulted a range of experts, and carefully considered the variety of expert and public comments on the topic. It was clear that reliable methods were available to define a syndrome characterized by sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (in severity or duration) and which was associated with a very significant increase in the risk of development of a full-fledged psychotic disorder (schizophrenia spectrum, psychotic mood disorder, and other psychotic disorders) within the next year. At the same time, the majority of individuals with "attenuated psychotic symptoms" had one or more other current psychiatric comorbid conditions (usually mood or anxiety disorders, substance use disorder; Fusar-Poli 2012) and exhibited a range of psychiatric outcomes other than conversion to psychosis (significant proportions either fully recover or develop some other psychiatric disorder, with a minority developing a psychotic disorder). Although the reliability of the diagnosis is well established in academic and research settings, it was found to be less so in community and other clinical settings. Furthermore, the nosological relationship of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) to schizotypal personality disorder and other psychiatric conditions was unclear. Further study will hopefully resolve these questions. The work group decided to recommend the inclusion of attenuated psychosis syndrome as a category in the appendix (Section3) of DSM-5 as a condition for further study. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the higher burden of depression among older women than men might be attributable to sex differences in the onset (ie, first or recurrent episodes) or persistence of depression and/or to differential mortality among those who are depressed. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: General community in greater New Haven, Connecticut, from March 23, 1998, to August 31, 2005. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 754 persons, 70 years or older, who were evaluated at 18-month intervals for 72 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 3 outcome states were depressed, nondepressed, and death, with scores of 20 or more and less than 20 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale denoting depressed and nondepressed, respectively. The association between sex and the likelihood of 6 possible transitions (namely, from nondepressed or depressed to nondepressed, depressed, or death) was evaluated over time. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression was substantially higher among women than men at each of the 5 time points (P {\textless} .001). In most cases, transitions between the nondepressed and depressed states were characterized by moderate to large absolute changes in depression scores (ie, {\textgreater} or = 10 points). Adjusting for other demographic characteristics, women had a higher likelihood of transitioning from nondepressed to depressed (odds ratio, 2.02; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.39-2.94) and a lower likelihood of transitioning from depressed to nondepressed (odds ratio, 0.27; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.13-0.56) or death (odds ratio, 0.24; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.09-0.60). CONCLUSION: Among older persons, the higher burden of depression in women than men seems to be attributable to a greater susceptibility to depression and, once depressed, to more persistent depression and a lower probability of death.},

Higher rates of psychiatric co-morbidity (OR=1.42; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI=1.26-1.61), older age (OR=1.04; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI=1.02-1.05), a younger age of onset (OR=0.97; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI=0.95-0.98) and more frequent episodes of depression (OR=1.75; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI=1.07-2.86) were found to be significant correlates of chronic depression. The first episode of depression for individuals with chronic depression often developed after the death of someone close (OR=2.38; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 1.16-5.79). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic depression is highly prevalent among community-residing persons and has a set of correlates that discriminate it from non-chronic depression. The distinction between chronic and non-chronic depression proposed for DSM-5, in the form of Chronic Depressive Disorder, seems to be warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Late-life depression may increase the risk of incident dementia, in particular of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of incident all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in individuals with late-life depression in population-based prospective studies.

METHOD: A total of 23 studies were included in the meta-analysis. We used the generic inverse variance method with a random-effects model to calculate the pooled risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in older adults with late-life depression.

RESULTS: Late-life depression was associated with a significant risk of all-cause dementia (1.85, 95{\%} CI 1.67-2.04, P{\textless}0.001), Alzheimer's disease (1.65, 95{\%} CI 1.42-1.92, P{\textless}0.001) and vascular dementia (2.52, 95{\%} CI 1.77-3.59, P{\textless}0.001). Subgroup analysis, based on five studies, showed that the risk of vascular dementia was significantly higher than for Alzheimer's disease (P = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: Late-life depression is associated with an increased risk for all-cause dementia, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The present results suggest that it will be valuable to design clinical trials to investigate the effect of late-life depression prevention on risk of dementia, in particular vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {In standard fMRI analysis all voxels are tested in a massive univariate approach, that is, each voxel is tested independently. This requires stringent corrections for multiple comparisons to control the number of false positive tests (i.e., marking voxels as active while they are actually not). As a result, fMRI analyses may suffer from low power to detect activation, especially in studies with high levels of noise in the data, for example developmental or single-subject studies. Activated region fitting (ARF) yields a solution by modeling fMRI data by multiple Gaussian shaped regions. ARF only requires a small number of parameters and therefore has increased power to detect activation. If required, the estimated regions can be directly used as regions of interest in a functional connectivity analysis. ARF is implemented in the R package arf3DS4. In this paper ARF and its implementation are described and illustrated with an example.},

abstract = {Several theories of emergence will be distinguished. In particular, these are synchronic, diachronic, and weak versions of emergence. While the weaker theories are compatible with property reductionism, synchronic emergentism and strong versions of diachronic emergentism are not. Synchronic emergentism is of particular interest for the discussion of downward causation. For such a theory, a system's property is taken to be emergent if it is irreducible, i.e., if it is not reductively explainable. Furthermore, we have to distinguish two different types of irreducibility with quite different consequences: If, on the one hand, a system's property is irreducible because of the irreducibility of the system's parts' behavior on which the property supervenes, we seem to have a case of “downward causation”. This kind of downward causation does not violate the principle of the causal closure of the physical domain. If, on the other hand, a systemic property is irreducible because it is not exhaustively analyzable in terms of its causal role, downward causation is not implied. Rather, it is dubitable how unanalyzable properties might play any causal role at all. Thus, epiphenomenalism seems to be implied. The failure to keep apart the two kinds of irreducibility has muddled recent debate about the emergence of properties considerably.},

abstract = {Valproate (the active moiety of both valproic acid and divalproex sodium) is commonly used as an adjunctive agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. Among the anticonvulsants, valproate is the most extensively studied in patients with schizophrenia. Theoretical underpinnings for valproate in schizophrenia include its effect on voltage-gated ion channels and on the g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, thus modulating mesolimbic dopaminergic activity. Case reports, retrospective studies, and randomized clinical trials support the use of valproate combined with antipsychotics in managing schizophrenia. A recently completed 28-day, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 249 patients with schizophrenia demonstrated faster improvement in psychopathology with a combination therapy of divalproex and risperidone or olanzapine, compared to monotherapy with risperidone or olanzapine. Additional research is needed to assess the utility of valproate in specialized populations such as those with treatment-refractory schizophrenia or agitation in schizophrenia. Regarding the latter, positive double-blind, randomized clinical trials have already been conducted in patients with borderline personality disorder, dementia, and with disruptive adolescents. It is anticipated that future research will focus on the new extended-release formulation of divalproex that can be administered on a once-daily basis.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation is to compare a new (double-mean-centering) strategy to estimating latent interactions in structural equation models with the (single) mean-centering strategy (Marsh, Wen, {\&} Hau, 2004, 2006) and the orthogonalizing strategy (Little, Bovaird, {\&} Widaman, 2006; Marsh et al., 2007). A key benefit of the orthogonalizing strategy is that it eliminated the need to estimate a mean structure as required by the mean-centering strategy, but required a potentially cumbersome 2-step estimation procedure. In contrast, the double-mean-centering strategy eliminates both the need for the mean structure and the cumbersome 2-stage estimation procedure. Furthermore, although the orthogonalizing and double-mean-centering strategies are equivalent when all indicators are normally distributed, the double-mean-centering strategy is superior when this normality assumption is violated. In summary, we recommend that applied researchers wanting to estimate latent interaction effects use the double-mean-centering strategy instead of either the single-mean-centering or orthogonalizing strategies, thus allowing them to ignore the cumbersome mean structure.},

abstract = {Summary: Purpose: The goal of neuroimaging in epilepsy is to localize the region of seizure onset. Single-photon emission computed tomography with tracer injection during seizures (ictal SPECT) is a promising tool for localizing seizures. However, much uncertainty exists about how to interpret late injections, or injections done after seizure end (postictal SPECT). A widely available and objective method is needed to interpret ambiguous ictal and postictal scans, with changes in multiple brain regions. Methods: Ictal or postictal SPECT scans were performed by using [99mTc]-labeled hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxime (HMPAO), and images were analyzed by comparison with interictal scans for each patient. Forty-seven cases of localized epilepsy were studied. We used methods that can be implemented anywhere, based on freely downloadable software and normal SPECT databases (http://spect.yale.edu). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to localize a single region of seizure onset based on ictal (or postictal) versus interictal difference images for each patient. We refer to this method as ictal–interictal SPECT analyzed by SPM (ISAS). Results: With this approach, ictal SPECT identified a single unambiguous region of seizure onset in 71{\%} of mesial temporal and 83{\%} of neocortical epilepsy cases, even with late injections, and the localization was correct in all (100{\%}) cases. Postictal SPECT, conversely, with injections performed soon after seizures, was very poor at localizing a single region based on either perfusion increases or decreases, often because changes were similar in multiple brain regions. However, measuring which hemisphere overall had more decreased perfusion with postictal SPECT, lateralized seizure onset to the correct side in ∼80{\%} of cases. Conclusions: ISAS provides a validated and readily available method for epilepsy SPECT analysis and interpretation. The results also emphasize the need to obtain SPECT injections during seizures to achieve unambiguous localization.},

abstract = {Since psychiatry remains a descriptive discipline, it is essential for its practitioners to understand how the language of psychiatry came to be formed. This important book, written by a psychiatrist-historian, traces the genesis of the descriptive categories of psychopathology and examines their interaction with the psychological and philosophical context within which they arose. Arguing that historical information should be available as freely to clinicians as are statistical and clinical data, the author explores particularly the language and ideas that have characterized descriptive psychopathology from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. In the early chapters descriptive psychopathology is defined as the theoretical set of vocabularies and protocols created to depict mental symptoms, and it is suggested that these symptoms result from the interaction between a signal, expressing a neurobiological lesion, and prevailing personal and psychosocial codes. The author considers the implications for current research of this fragmentation of abnormal behaviour into a narrow repertoire of symptoms. Following on from this introduction, this absorbing work consists of a masterful survey of the history of the main psychiatric symptoms, from the metaphysics of classical antiquity to the operational criteria of today. Tracing the evolution of concepts such as memory, consciousness, will and personality, and of symptoms ranging from catalepsy and aboulia to anxiety and self-harm, this part of the book provides fascinating insights into the subjective nature of mental illness, and into the ideas of British, Continental and American authorities who sought to clarify and define it. For all those attempting to understand or treat mental disorders, this is an essential account of the foundations of their discipline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The population of older adults in long-term care (LTC) is expected to increase considerably in the near future. An understanding of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in LTC will help in planning mental health services for this population. This study reviews the prevalence of common psychiatric disorders in LTC populations. METHODS: We searched electronic databases for studies on the prevalence of major psychiatric disorders in LTC using medical subject headings and key words. We only included studies using validated measures for diagnosing psychiatric disorders or psychiatric symptoms. Our review focused on the following psychiatric disorders: dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), major depression, depressive symptoms, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and alcohol use disorders. We also determined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the U.S. LTC population using data from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). RESULTS: A total of 74 studies examining the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychological symptoms in LTC populations were identified including 30 studies on the prevalence of dementia, 9 studies on behavioral symptoms in dementia, and 26 studies on depression. Most studies involved few LTC facilities and were conducted in developed countries. Dementia had a median prevalence (58{\%}) in studies while the prevalence of BPSD was 78{\%} among individuals with dementia. The median prevalence of major depressive disorder was 10{\%} while the median prevalence of depressive symptoms was 29{\%} among LTC residents. There were few studies on other psychiatric disorders. Results from the 2004 NNHS were consistent with those in the published literature. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia, depression and anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among older adults in LTC. Many psychiatric disorders appear to be more prevalent in LTC settings when compared to those observed in community-dwelling older adults. Policy-makers and clinicians should be aware of the common psychiatric disorders in LTC and further research into effective prevention and treatments are required for this growing population.},

Controversies persist as to how best to define it, distinguish its subtypes and set their limits. Attempts to provide this syndrome with a better conceptual framework have usually relied on proposing new definitions and classifications. In this article, we suggest that some prevailing difficulties are basically related to two separate but intertwined issues: the self-reflexive property of the human mental functioning and the first-person linguistic expression of human experience. We argue that this discussion belongs to a broader context than the one it is usually referred to, as it deals with problems germane to conceptual psychopathological investigations in general. In that regard, DMS provides us with a very telling example, to the extent to which it has, at its core, to account for the puzzling phenomena of identity, which are particularly affected by cultural and linguistic variables.},

The present study aimed to test whether the Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS) could be detected in a college population by checking self-report results against an additional interview. A two-stage screening process was used in a sample of 579 college students (16-22 years old): a 16-item Chinese version of the Prodromal Questionnaire (CPQ-16) followed by the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS). Psychopathology symptoms were assessed using the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). There were 20 (3.5{\{}{\%}{\}}) students who met the criteria for the APS according to SIPS. Compared with control students, the students with APS were more likely to be from divorced families and had more psychopathology based on the SCL-90. Certain factors on the SCL-90, including Obsessive-Compulsive (OBS), Interpersonal Sensitivity (INT), and Depression (DEP) were significantly correlated with positive psychosis risk symptoms on the SIPS, but only DEP had a strong correlation with the total score on the SIPS. These results demonstrate that the APS can be detected in a college sample and that psychosis risk symptoms are associated with co-occurring psychopathology.},

METHODS: We examined the relationship of structural brain alterations, identified using voxel-based morphometry, to cognitive deficits in 45 schizophrenia patients relative to 43 healthy control subjects and tested the hypothesis that structure-cognition relationship is altered in schizophrenia. RESULTS: Patients had smaller total brain, gray matter, and white matter volumes. Regional alterations were left-hemisphere specific, including: gray matter reduction of inferior frontal, lingual, and anterior superior temporal gyri; white matter reduction of posterior and occipital lobes; and gray matter increase of the putamen and the precuneus. Smaller whole brain and gray matter volumes were associated with lower premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) and poorer performance on IQ-dependent cognitive measures in patients and to a similar extent in control subjects. Larger precuneus was associated with better immediate verbal memory in patients, whereas verbal and nonverbal memory were positively associated with inferior frontal gyrus volume in control subjects. Smaller occipital white matter volume was associated with slower information processing speed in patients but not in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Regional volume alterations are associated with specific cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Some structure-cognition relationships differentiate this population from healthy control subjects.},

abstract = {The complex relationship between temperament and personal identity, and between these and mental disorders, is of critical interest to both philosophy and psychopathology. More than other living creatures, human beings are constituted and characterized by the interplay of their genotype and phenotype. There appears to be an explanatory gap between the almost perfect genetic identity and the individual differences among humans. One reason for this gap is that a human being is a person besides a physiological organism. We propose an outline of a theoretical model that might somewhat mitigate the explanatory discrepancies between physiological mechanisms and individual human emotional experience and behaviour. Arguing for the pervasive nature of human affectivity, i.e., for the assumption that human consciousness and behaviour is characterised by being permeated by affectivity; to envisage the dynamics of emotional experience, we make use of a three-levelled model of human personal identity that differentiates between factors that are simultaneously at work in the constitution of the individual human person: 1) core emotions, 2) affective temperament types/affective character traits, and 3) personhood. These levels are investigated separately in order to respect the methodological diversity among them (neuroscience, psychopathology, and philosophy), but they are eventually brought together in a hermeneutical account of human personhood.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relationship among childhood trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and adult social support in a large sample of veterans who served in the military after 09/11/2001, with a specific focus on the potential role of the PTSD avoidance and numbing cluster as intervening in the association between childhood abuse and adult functional social support. METHOD: Participants were 1,301 veterans and active duty soldiers who have served in the military since 09/11/2001; a subsample of these participants (n=482) completed an inventory of current functional social support. Analyses included linear regression and nonparametric bootstrapping procedures. RESULTS: After controlling for combat exposure, exposure to childhood trauma was associated with PTSD symptoms in adulthood. Further, PTSD symptoms, and particularly PTSD avoidance/numbing cluster symptoms, intervened in the relationship between childhood trauma and adult functional social support. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the association of childhood trauma (both abuse related and other, non-abuse related trauma) with PTSD symptoms in military personnel and veterans, even after accounting for combat exposure. Additionally, the avoidance and numbing symptom cluster of childhood trauma-based PTSD may be particularly salient in compromising one's subsequent ability to garner functional social support in adulthood.},

The prepsychotic personalities of our patients show the usual variation found in any group of people. 5. A good social and industrial adjustment, the presence of a definite and specific environmental stress, the interest in life and its opportunities, and the absence of any passivity or withdrawal are some of the factors favoring recovery.},

Of 438 patients, 154 were randomized to risperidone, 144 to haloperidol, and 140 to placebo. The mean+/-S.D. modal doses were 4.2+/-1.7 mg/day of risperidone and 8.0+/-3.6 mg/day of haloperidol during the initial 3-week phase and 4.1+/-1.8 and 7.4+/-3.7 mg/day during the 12-week period. At week 3, mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score reductions from baseline were significantly greater in patients receiving risperidone than placebo (p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.001). Differences between risperidone and haloperidol on this efficacy measure were not significant. Further reductions in YMRS scores were seen in patients receiving risperidone or haloperidol during the subsequent 9 weeks. No unexpected adverse events were reported. Extrapyramidal disorder and hyperkinesias, the most commonly reported adverse events with antipsychotic use, occurred less frequently with risperidone than haloperidol. We conclude that risperidone monotherapy was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for bipolar mania and that efficacy was maintained over the long term.},

Human subjectivity is shaped and in-formed (formed by inner processes) that are adapted to the human life-world and embody meaning and the relatedness of a human being. Questions of identity relate to this complex and dynamic reality to reflect the fact that biology, human ecology, culture, and one's historic-political situation are inscribed in one's neural network and have configured its architecture so that it is a unique and irreplaceable phenomenon. So much is a human individual a relational being whose own understanding and ownership of his or her life is both situated and distinctive that neurophilosophical conceptions of identity and human activity that neglect these features of our being are quite inadequate to ground a robust neuroethics.},

This study, which investigates the validity of the MINI in relation to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Patients (SCID-P), was conducted in conjunction with a similar study, investigating the validity of the MINI in relation to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for International Statistical Classification of Disease (ICD)-10. Both studies also examined the inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the MINI. Three hundred and seventy subjects (330 in Florida and 40 in Paris) participated in the validation of the MINI versus the SCID-P. Of these, 308 had at least one psychiatric disorder and 62 were non-patient adult controls. Eighty of the subjects (40 in Florida and 40 in Paris) also participated in the parallel study of the validity of the MINI versus the CIDI. The 330 Florida subjects first completed the patient-rated version of the MINI. All subjects were administered the MINI-CR (after the MIM-PR in the case of the Florida subjects), followed by the SCID-P. The MINI-CR was rated by two interviewers for 42 subjects in Florida and 42 in Paris (inter-rater reliability test) and readministered by a third blind interviewer one to two days after the initial rating (test-retest reliability test). Overall, the results supported the validity and reliability of the MINI. In addition, administration of the MINI-CR took half as long as administration of corresponding sections of the SCID-P. The application of short structured interviews in clinical and research settings is discussed},

abstract = {Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) may afford a more rapid and extensive survey of gray matter abnormalities in schizophrenia than manually drawn region of interest (ROI) analysis, the current gold standard in structural MRI. Unfortunately, VBM has not been validated by comparison with ROI analyses, nor used in first-episode patients with schizophrenia or affective psychosis, who lack structural changes associated with chronicity. An SPM99-based implementation of VBM was used to compare a group of 16 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and a group of 18 normal controls and, as a further comparison, 16 first-episode patients with affective psychosis. All groups were matched for age and handedness. High spatial resolution structural images were normalized to the SPM99 template and then segmented, smoothed, and subjected to an ANCOVA. Schizophrenia vs control group comparisons: Voxel-by-voxel comparison of gray matter densities showed that only the left STG region was significantly different when corrected for multiple comparisons P {\textless} .05), consistent with our previously reported manual ROI results. Analysis of the extent of voxel clusters, replicated with permutation analyses, revealed group differences in bilateral anterior cingulate gyri and insula (not previously examined by us with manually drawn ROI) and unilateral parietal lobe, but not in medial temporal lobe (where our ROI analysis had shown differences). However, use of a smaller smoothing kernel and a small volume correction revealed left-sided hippocampal group differences. Affective psychosis comparisons: When the same statistical thresholding criteria were used, no significant differences between affective psychosis patients and controls were noted. Since a major interest was whether patients with affective psychosis shared some anatomical abnormalities with schizophrenia, we applied a small volume correction and searched within the regions that were significantly less dense in schizophrenia compared to control subjects. With this statistical correction, the insula showed, bilaterally, the same pattern of differences in affective disorder subjects as that in schizophrenic subjects, whereas both left STG and left hippocampus showed statistical differences between affectives and schizophrenics, indicating the abnormalities specific to first-episode schizophrenia. These findings suggest both the promise and utility of VBM in evaluating gray matter abnormalities. They further suggest the importance of comparing VBM findings with more traditional ROI analyses until the reasons for the differences between methods are determined.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Executive function deficits in depression implicate involvement of frontal-striatal circuits. However, studies of hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA) function suggest that stress-related brain changes of hippocampus may also implicate prefrontal-hippocampal circuits, which may explain the profile of both executive dysfunction and memory deficits. In this study we examined the performance of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) on tasks of memory and executive function in relation to melancholic features and to cortisol levels. Our hypothesis was that raised cortisol levels in melancholic patients would correlate with these deficits. METHOD: Forty female MDD patients, 20 having melancholic features (MEL vs. Non-MEL), and 20 sex-age- and education-matched normal controls were investigated using the Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery (CANTAB), to assess memory (paired associative learning, PAL; short-term recognition memory, SRM) and executive (intradimensional/extradimensional set-shifting, ID/ED; Stockings of Cambridge, SOC) functions. Plasma and salivary cortisol levels were measured. RESULTS: The MDD patients performed worse than controls on PAL and both executive tasks. The MEL group differed from controls on all tests, and differed from the non-MEL only at the ED stage of the ID/ED task. Patient cortisol levels were within the normal range and did not correlate with neuropsychological performance for any group. CONCLUSIONS: MDD patients showed neuropsychological deficits on tasks of executive function and memory, supporting the model of frontal-temporal dysfunction. MEL vs. non-MEL performed worse overall and demonstrated a qualitative difference in set shifting, perhaps implicating more extensive prefrontal involvement. Cortisol levels did not correlate with depression severity or the observed deficits.},

This review discusses the structural changes in the six editions and the research that influenced those changes.

abstract = {Since the previous publication of Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines in 1997, there has been a substantial increase in evidence-based treatment options for bipolar disorder. The present guidelines review the new evidence and use criteria to rate strength of evidence and incorporate effectiveness, safety, and tolerability data to determine global clinical recommendations for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. The guidelines suggest that although pharmacotherapy forms the cornerstone of management, utilization of adjunctive psychosocial treatments and incorporation of chronic disease management model involving a healthcare team are required in providing optimal management for patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics are first-line treatments for acute mania. Bipolar depression and mixed states are frequently associated with suicidal acts; therefore assessment for suicide should always be an integral part of managing any bipolar patient. Lithium, lamotrigine or various combinations of antidepressant and mood-stabilizing agents are first-line treatments for bipolar depression. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder are lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. Historical and symptom profiles help with treatment selection. With the growing recognition of bipolar II disorders, it is anticipated that a larger body of evidence will become available to guide treatment of this common and disabling condition. These guidelines also discuss issues related to bipolar disorder in women and those with comorbidity and include a section on safety and monitoring.},

The posting by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group has been helpful in informing the field of the possible changes that may occur with DSM-5. Their presence allows for and encourages persons to provide their suggestions and concerns. The extent of the proposals is considerable. As expressed on the website, "the work group recommends a major reconceptualization of personality psychopathology" (Skodol, 2010, "Reformulation of personality disorders in DSM-5," para. 1). The proposals have generated some controversy. The Journal of Personality Disorders has always sought to be a participant in the crucial debates in our field. The purpose of this special issue is to provide members of the Work Group the opportunity to further articulate the rationale for the proposals, and to provide others an opportunity to articulate their concerns. Copies of this special issue were distributed to interested persons when the complete set of final papers were received (October of 2010).},

Doctors who may have little experience in the management of ADHD or use of psychostimulants are faced with decisions on whether to continue or withdraw medication. A literature search conducted to clarify these issues revealed that, although psychostimulants are generally efficacious in ADHD, the risks of withdrawal reactions and of possible long-term effects such as drug addiction, psychosis and depression, or effects in pregnancy, have not been adequately investigated. In particular, there is little information on the effects of withdrawal and no firm guidelines on methods of psychostimulant discontinuation. There is a need for further research to clarify the pharmacological issues involved in the drug treatment of ADHD and for overlapping arrangements between child and adult psychiatry clinics in the management of ADHD.},

abstract = {Research indicates that disturbance of the basic sense of self may be a core phenotypic marker of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Basic self-disturbance refers to a disruption of the sense of ownership of experience and agency of action and is associated with a variety of anomalous subjective experiences. In this study, we investigated the presence of basic self-disturbance in an "ultra high risk" (UHR) for psychosis sample compared with a healthy control sample and whether it predicted transition to psychotic disorder.Methods:Forty-nine UHR patients and 52 matched healthy control participants were recruited to the study. Participants were assessed for basic self-disturbance using the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE) instrument. UHR participants were followed for a mean of 569 days.Results:Levels of self-disturbance were significantly higher in the UHR sample compared with the healthy control sample (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} .001). Cox regression indicated that total EASE score significantly predicted time to transition (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} .05) when other significant predictors were controlled for. Exploratory analyses indicated that basic self-disturbance scores were higher in schizophrenia spectrum cases, irrespective of transition to psychosis, than nonschizophrenia spectrum cases.Discussion:The results indicate that identifying basic self-disturbance in the UHR population may provide a means of further "closing in" on individuals truly at high risk of psychotic disorder, particularly of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This may be of practical value by reducing inclusion of "false positive" cases in UHR samples and of theoretical value by shedding light on core phenotypic features of schizophrenia spectrum pathology.},

abstract = {Summary:  Purpose: Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is an image-analysis tool that assesses the statistical significance of cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes on a voxel-by-voxel basis, thereby removing the subjectivity inherent in conventional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. Our platform of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ictal–interictal difference imaging in clinical epilepsy has been validated for localizing seizure onset. We extend the tools of SPM by further applying statistical measures for the significance of perfusion changes in individual patients to localize epileptogenic foci in patients with defined temporal lobe epilepsy by using paired scans in this preliminary study. Methods: Twelve patients with pairs of periictal and interictal SPECT scans were analyzed in this comparison study between SPECT difference imaging and SPM difference analysis by using a reference database of paired normal healthy images. These 12 patients possessed seizure foci localized to the mesial temporal lobe as confirmed by surgical outcome and by hippocampal sclerosis on pathology. SPM was used to identify clusters of increased or decreased CBF in each patient in contrast to our control group. Results: The regions having the most significant increased or decreased CBF by SPM analysis were in agreement with regions identified by conventional difference imaging and visual analysis by viewers blinded to the results of the SPM analysis. Differentiated further by time of radiopharmaceutical injection, six of seven patients injected within 100 s of seizure onset displayed hyperperfusion changes localized to the corresponding epileptogenic temporal lobe by both techniques. Among patients receiving injections after 100 s, both techniques showed primarily regions of hypoperfusion, which again were similar between these two methods. Conclusions: The results provide strong evidence supporting SPM difference analysis in assessing regions of significant CBF change from baseline in concordance with our current clinically used technique of SPECT ictal–interictal difference imaging in epilepsy patients. Difference analysis using SPM could serve as a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of seizure focus in temporal lobe epilepsy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate white matter volume abnormalities in patients with major depression and the effects of antidepressant treatment on white matter volume.

METHOD: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 32 treatment-na{\"{i}}ve depressed patients, 17 recovered patients who had received antidepressant treatment and subsequently achieved clinical recovery and 34 matched controls.

RESULTS: Relative to the healthy controls, the treatment-na{\"{i}}ve depressed patients showed increased white matter volumes in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left putamen and reduced white matter volumes in the left cerebellum posterior lobe and left inferior parietal lobule. For the treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients, the length in months of the current depressive episode was positively correlated with the white matter volumes in both the left DLPFC and left putamen. In the recovered patients, the differences in white matter volume were no longer statistically significant relative to healthy controls. No significant difference was found in the total white matter volume among the three groups.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there were alterations in the white matter volumes of depressed patients, which might disrupt the neural circuits that are involved in emotional and cognitive function and thus contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. The finding of the significant correlations between refractoriness and the white matter volumes in the left DLPFC and left putamen combined with the finding that antidepressant treatment normalized the white matter volume of recovered patients, suggests that a quantitative, structural MRI measurement could act as a potential biomarker in depression therapy for individual subjects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The environment can moderate the effect of genes - a phenomenon called gene-environment (GxE) interaction. Several studies have found that socioeconomic status (SES) modifies the heritability of children's intelligence. Among low-SES families, genetic factors have been reported to explain less of the variance in intelligence; the reverse is found for high-SES families. The evidence however is inconsistent. Other studies have reported an effect in the opposite direction (higher heritability in lower SES), or no moderation of the genetic effect on intelligence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using 8716 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), we attempted to replicate the reported moderating effect of SES on children's intelligence at ages 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 14: i.e., lower heritability in lower-SES families. We used a twin model that allowed for a main effect of SES on intelligence, as well as a moderating effect of SES on the genetic and environmental components of intelligence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found greater variance in intelligence in low-SES families, but minimal evidence of GxE interaction across the eight ages. A power calculation indicated that a sample size of about 5000 twin pairs is required to detect moderation of the genetic component of intelligence as small as 0.25, with about 80{\%} power - a difference of 11{\%} to 53{\%} in heritability, in low- (-2 standard deviations, SD) and high-SES (+2 SD) families. With samples at each age of about this size, the present study found no moderation of the genetic effect on intelligence. However, we found the greater variance in low-SES families is due to moderation of the environmental effect - an environment-environment interaction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In a UK-representative sample, the genetic effect on intelligence is similar in low- and high-SES families. Children's shared experiences appear to explain the greater variation in intelligence in lower SES.},

We have previously shown that cognition shares substantial genetic variance with schizophrenia; however, it is unknown if this reflects pleiotropic effects, direct causality or some shared third factor that links both, for example, brain volume (BV) changes. We quantified the degree of net genetic overlap and tested the direction of causation between schizophrenia liability, brain structure and cognition in a pan-European schizophrenia twin cohort consisting of 1243 members from 626 pairs. Cognitive deficits lie upstream of the liability for schizophrenia with about a quarter of the variance in liability to schizophrenia explained by variation in cognitive function. BV changes lay downstream of schizophrenia liability, with 4{\%} of BV variation explained directly by variation in liability. However, our power to determine the nature of the relationship between BV deviation and schizophrenia liability was more limited. Thus, while there was strong evidence that cognitive impairment is causal to schizophrenia liability, we are not in a position to make a similar statement about the relationship between liability and BV. This is the first study to demonstrate that schizophrenia liability is expressed partially through cognitive deficits. One prediction of the finding that BV changes lie downstream of the disease liability is that the risk loci that influence schizophrenia liability will thereafter influence BV and to a lesser extent. By way of contrast, cognitive function lies upstream of schizophrenia, thus the relevant loci will actually have a larger effect size on cognitive function than on schizophrenia. These are testable predictions.},

It represents one of the most succinct contemporary surveys of German psychiatric discourse in the 1880s. It also outlines Kraepelin's own research priorities in the early years of his career, providing important historical background to the motives that drove him to place such great emphasis on (and hope in) experimental psychology. Contrary to our contemporary image of Kraepelin as a grand clinical nosologist, this text shows that he was much more of a diagnostician and experimental psychologist than historians have generally assumed. The document also reflects a wider 'psychological turn' in German psychiatry, away from patho-anatomic study - a turn that has often been overlooked in the historiographic literature.},

Reciprocally, palpitations caused by paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) are commonly associated with anxiety and may therefore be misdiagnosed as PD. As demonstrated by two case reports, PSVT and PD can occur comorbidly in a chronological sequence, with PSVT possibly precipitating and maintaining PD via interoceptive processes or, alternatively, with PD increasing the risk for PSVT by elevating stress levels. As both PSVT and PD require different treatments, potentially helpful differential clinical diagnostic criteria are proposed.},

abstract = {The paper outlines the role that tacit knowledge plays in what might seem to be an area of knowledge that can be made fully explicit or codified and which forms a central element of Evidence Based Medicine. Appeal to the role the role of tacit knowledge in science provides a way to unify the tripartite definition of Evidence Based Medicine given by Sackett et al: the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. Each of these three elements, crucially including research evidence, rests on an ineliminable and irreducible notion of uncodified good judgement. The paper focuses on research evidence, drawing first on the work of Kuhn to suggest that tacit knowledge contributes, as a matter of fact, to puzzle solving within what he calls normal science. A stronger argument that it must play a role in research is first motivated by looking to Collins' first hand account of replication in applied physics and then broader considerations of replication in justifying knowledge claims in scientific research. Finally, consideration of an argument from Wittgenstein shows that whatever explicit guidelines can be drawn up to guide judgement the specification of what counts as correctly following them has to remain implicit.Overall, the paper sets out arguments for the claim that even though explicit guidelines and codifications can play a practical role in informing clinical practice, they rest on a body of tacit or implicit skill that is in principle ineliminable. It forms the bedrock of good judgement and unites the integration of research, expertise and values.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This review aimed to address the question of whether cognitive impairment should be considered a core feature of depression that may be a valuable target for treatment. METHOD: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive function, assessed with a single neuropsychological test battery, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in patients with depression during symptomatic and remitted states. Inclusion of studies comparing patients remitted from depression and controls enabled us to investigate whether cognitive impairment persists beyond episodes of low mood in depression. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory and attention in patients with depression relative to controls (Cohen's d effect sizes ranging from -0.34 to -0.65). Significant moderate deficits in executive function and attention (Cohen's d ranging from -0.52 to -0.61) and non-significant small/moderate deficits in memory (Cohen's d ranging from -0.22 to -0.54) were found to persist in patients whose depressive symptoms had remitted, indicating that cognitive impairment occurs separately from episodes of low mood in depression. CONCLUSIONS: Both low mood and cognitive impairment are associated with poor psychosocial functioning. Therefore, we argue that remediation of cognitive impairment and alleviation of depressive symptoms each play an important role in improving outcome for patients with depression. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that cognitive impairment represents a core feature of depression that cannot be considered an epiphenomenon that is entirely secondary to symptoms of low mood and that may be a valuable target for future interventions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses are heterogeneous in disease course and functional outcomes. We review evidence from investigations in clinical psychiatry, neuroimaging, neurocognition, and blood biomarker research suggesting that distinct bio-psycho-social patterns exist at the onset and during the early phase of a First Episode Psychosis (FEP), which can describe the risk of individual illness progression and functional trajectories. METHOD: A selective literature review was performed on articles drawn from Medline searches for relevant key words. A simulation model was constructed from data derived from two recent publications, selected as examples of studies that investigated multivariate predictors of long-term outcome following FEP. RESULTS: We illustrate how illness trajectories following FEP could be described based on multimodal sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and neurobiological information. A clinical modeling simulation shows thatrisk trajectories for achieving long-term favorable or unfavorable outcomes can differ significantly depending on baseline characteristics in combination with MRI and functional measurements within 6 months of disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal trajectory modeling may be useful to describe longitudinal outcomes following FEP. Richlongitudinal data on predictors and outcomes, and better integration of multimodal (sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, biological) data, are required to operationalize this approach. This technique may improve our understanding of course of illness and help to provide a more personalized approach to the assessment and treatment of people presenting with FEP.},

For instance, the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in the DSM-5 will require evidence of self- and interpersonal impairment as well as elevated scores on traits of emotional lability, anxiousness, separation insecurity, depressivity, impulsivity, risk taking, and hostility. Using a sample of individuals from the community (N = 134), half of whom were receiving psychiatric treatment, we tested whether the summation of relevant personality trait scores, using data derived from a measure of the Five-Factor Model of personality (FFM), would result in a construct that corresponds to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSMIV, American Psychiatric Association, 2000) BPD construct as scored by expert consensus ratings.

Although the stimulant medications tend to show a dose-related improvement in ADHD symptoms, atomoxetine is generally dosed based on weight. The literature clearly documents that stimulants improve not only abnormal behaviors of ADHD but also self-esteem, cognition, and social and family functioning. However, efficacy varies with age and psychiatric comorbidities. Although most of the existing studies are brief, an increasing number of long-term studies have documented persistent response up to 1 and 2 years. Recent studies are extending the knowledge of treatment to younger and older subjects, women, and ethnic minorities. Cognitive and cognitive/behaviorally based psychotherapies combined with medication may play a role in treating behavioral and organizational issues and comorbid psychopathology.},

abstract = {The contemporary epistemic status of mental health disciplines does not allow the cross validation of mental disorders among various genetic markers, biochemical pathway or mechanisms, and clinical assessments in neuroscience explanations. We attempt to provide a meta-empirical analysis of the contemporary status of the cross-disciplinary issues existing between neuro-biology and psychopathology. Our case studies take as an established medical mode an example cross validation between biological sciences and clinical cardiology in the case of myocardial infarction. This is then contrasted with the incoherence between neuroscience and psychiatry in the case of bipolar disorders. We examine some methodological problems arising from the neuro-imaging studies, specifically the experimental paradigm introduced by the team of Wayne Drevets. Several theoretical objections are raised: temporal discordance, state independence, and queries about the reliability and specificity, and failure of convergent validity of the inter-disciplinary attempt. Both modern neuroscience and clinical psychology taken as separate fields have failed to reveal the explanatory mechanisms underlying mental disorders. The data acquired inside the mono-disciplinary matrices of neurobiology and psychopathology are deeply insufficient concerning their validity, reliability, and utility. Further, there haven't been developed any effective trans-disciplinary connections between them. It raises the requirement for development of explanatory significant multi-disciplinary “meta-language” in psychiatry (Berrios, 2006, 2008). We attempt to provide a novel conceptual model for an integrative dialogue between psychiatry and neuroscience that actually includes criteria for cross-validation of the common used psychiatric categories and the different assessment methods. The major goal of our proactive program is the foundation of complementary “bridging” connections of neuroscience and psychopathology which may stabilize the cognitive meta-structure of the mental health knowledge. This entails bringing into synergy the disparate discourses of clinical psychology and neuroscience. One possible model accomplishment of this goal would be the synergistic (or at least compatible) integration of the knowledge under trans-disciplinary convergent cross-validation of the commonly used methods and notions.},

abstract = {The rise of the early intervention paradigm in psychotic disorders represents a maturing of the therapeutic approach in psychiatry, as it embraces practical preventive strategies which are firmly established in mainstream health care. Early intervention means better access and systematic early delivery of existing and incremental improvements in knowledge rather than necessarily requiring dramatic and elusive breakthroughs. A clinical staging model has proven useful and may have wider utility in psychiatry. The earliest clinical stages of psychotic disorder are non-specific and multidimensional and overlap phenotypically with the initial stages of other disorders. This implies that treatment should proceed in a stepwise fashion depending upon safety, response and progression. Withholding treatment until severe and less reversible symptomatic and functional impairment have become entrenched represents a failure of care. While early intervention in psychosis has developed strongly in recent years, many countries have made no progress at all, and others have achieved only sparse coverage. The reform process has been substantially evidence-based, arguably more so than other system reforms in mental health. However, while evidence is necessary, it is insufficient. It is also a by-product as well as a catalyst of reform. In early psychosis, we have also seen the evidence-based paradigm misused to frustrate overdue reform. Mental disorders are the chronic diseases of the young, with their onset and maximum impact in late adolescence and early adult life. A broader focus for early intervention would solve many of the second order issues raised by the early psychosis reform process, such as diagnostic uncertainty despite a clear-cut need for care, stigma and engagement, and should be more effective in mobilizing community support. Early intervention represents a vital and challenging project for early adopters in global psychiatry to consider.},

With the structured interview "IRAOS," the onset and course of schizophrenia and substance abuse were retrospectively assessed in a representative first-episode sample of 232 schizophrenic patients. Information by relatives validated the patients' reports. Alcohol abuse prior to first admission was found in 24{\%}, drug abuse in 14{\%}-twice the rates in the general population. Alcohol abuse more often followed than preceded the first symptom of schizophrenia. Drug abuse preceded the first symptom in 27.5{\%}, followed it in 37.9{\%}, and emerged within the same month in 34.6{\%} of the cases. The study demonstrates a remarkable association between first-episode schizophrenia and substance abuse, but a unidirectional causality is not supported, nor is a specific psychotic disorder in comorbid cases.},

abstract = {Background: Despite extensive early detection research in schizophrenic psychoses, methods for identifying at-risk individuals and predicting their transition to psychosis are still unreliable. Moreover, there are sparse data on long-term prediction. We therefore investigated long-term psychosis transition in individuals with an At Risk Mental State (ARMS) and examined the relative efficacy of clinical and neuropsychological status in optimizing the prediction of transition. Methods: Sixty-four individuals with ARMS for psychosis were identified from all referrals to our early detection clinic between March 1, 2000 and February 29, 2004. Fifty-three (83{\{}{\%}{\}}) were followed up for up to 7 (mean 5.4) years. Results: Twenty-one of the 53 staying in follow-up developed psychosis, corresponding to a transition rate of .34 (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Median time to transition was 10 months (range {\{}{\textless}{\}}1-55). Six of all transitions (29{\{}{\%}{\}}) occurred only after 12 months from referral. Best transition predictors within this population were selected attenuated psychotic symptoms (suspiciousness), negative symptoms (anhedonia/asociality), and cognitive deficits (reduced speed of information processing). With these predictors in an integrated model for predicting transition to psychosis, the overall predictive accuracy was 80.9{\{}{\%}{\}} with a sensitivity of 83.3{\{}{\%}{\}} and a specificity of 79.3{\{}{\%}{\}}. Conclusions: Follow-up of ARMS subjects should exceed the usual 12 months. Prediction of transitions could be improved by a stronger weighting of certain early symptoms and by introducing neurocognitive tests into a stepwise risk assessment. Confirmatory research will hopefully further improve risk algorithm, including psychopathology and neuropsychological performance, for clinical application in early detection clinics. ?? 2009 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether acutely depressed, medication-free subjects show an exaggerated release of cortisol in saliva in relation to awakening. METHODS: We studied the pattern of waking salivary cortisol in 20 unmedicated acutely depressed subjects and 40 healthy controls. RESULTS: In both groups, salivary cortisol increased rapidly after waking, peaking at 30 min. Overall, patients with acute depression secreted approximately 25{\%} more cortisol than controls, though 60 min after waking, their cortisol levels were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed patients in the community appear to have increased early morning cortisol secretion, but the demonstration of this effect requires control for time of waking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The observation that bipolar disorders frequently go unrecognized has prompted the development of screening instruments designed to improve the identification of bipolarity in clinical and non-clinical samples. Starting from a lifetime approach, researchers of the Spectrum Project developed the Mood Spectrum Self-Report (MOODS-SR) that assesses threshold-level manifestations of unipolar and bipolar mood psychopathology, but also atypical symptoms, behavioral traits and temperamental features. The aim of the present study is to examine the structure of mania/hypomania using 68 items of the MOODS-SR that explore cognitive, mood and energy/activity features associated with mania/hypomania. METHODS: A data pool of 617 patients with bipolar disorders, recruited at Pittsburgh and Pisa, Italy was used for this purpose. Classical exploratory factor analysis, based on a tetrachoric matrix, was carried out on the 68 items, followed by an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based factor analytic approach. RESULTS: Nine factors were initially identified, that include Psychomotor Activation, Creativity, Mixed Instability, Sociability/Extraversion, Mixed Irritability, Inflated Self-esteem, Euphoria, Wastefulness/Recklessness, and account overall for 56.4{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variance of items. In a subsequent IRT-based bi-factor analysis, only five of them (Psychomotor Activation, Mixed Instability, Mixed Irritability, Euphoria) were retained. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the central role of Psychomotor Activation in mania/hypomania and support the definitions of pure manic (Psychomotor Activation and Euphoria) and mixed manic (Mixed Instability and Mixed Irritability) components, bearing the opportunity to identify patients with specific profiles for a better clinical and neurobiological definition.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studiesofemotion, personality, and social cognition have drawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high (e.g., {\textgreater}.8) correlations between brain activation and personality measures. We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in fMRI research of many kinds—not just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a disorder consisting of an array of behavioural and psychological abnormalities influenced by multiple genetic loci. Efforts to localize schizophrenia susceptibility genes through linkage strategies or association studies have not arrived at any conclusive results. The lack of success stems in part from the evident complexity of schizophrenia, probably involving the combined action of a number of different genes as well as environmental influences. Furthermore, investigation of one of the major clues to schizophrenia, that is the mechanism of action of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications, has not as yet provided significant insight into the disease pathogenesis. In this review we provide an overview of schizophrenia genetics including genes implicated in the neurodevelopmental model, and N-methyl-D-aspartate system in schizophrenia. In addition we update the reader on the rapidly emerging topic of pharmacogenetics, discussing genes that influence response to antipsychotic medications and development of side effects in schizophrenia.

Many patterns of preference were distinguished and there were no marked differences between adjacent classes. These findings are believed to demonstrate that hand preference is distributed continuously and not discretely. When it is necessary to classify handedness, the preference continuum can be divided at several levels of discrimination. A second study of hand preference and manual speed showed that it is possible to order the main preference groups for asymmetry of manual skill. Some of the problems of studies of laterality are examined as possible consequences of the treatment of a continuous distribution as if it were discrete.},

@article{Fountoulakis2005,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The development of treatment guidelines emerged as an important element so as to standardize treatment and to provide clinicians with algorithms, which would be able to carry research findings to the everyday clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The MEDLINE was searched with the combination of each one of the key words 'mania', 'manic', 'bipolar', 'manic-depression', 'manic-depressive' with 'treatment guidelines'. RESULTS: The search was updated until March 1st, 2004 and returned 224 articles. Twenty-seven papers concerning the publication of treatment algorithms were traced. DISCUSSION: Despite supposedly being evidence-based, guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder vary significantly across committees or working groups. Overall, however, at the first stage of the mania/hypomania algorithm, monotherapy with lithium, divalproex sodium or olanzapine is generally recommended. At latter stages combination therapy is strongly recommended. It is clearly stated that in bipolar depression antidepressants should be used only in combination with antimanic agents in order to avoid switching of phases. During the maintenance phase all patients should receive antimanic agents, while some may need the addition of antidepressants. The most recent guidelines emphasize the use of atypical antipsychotics for mania and lamotrigine for depression. The main problem with guidelines is that they are rapidly outdated and that the evidence base relies mainly on registration monotherapy trials that hardly reflect treatment in routine clinical conditions. CONCLUSION: Treatment guidelines may be useful to avoid non-evidence-based treatment decisions, but they are quickly out-of-date and may not fully apply to the clinical setting. The more recent guidelines point the value of atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and valproate in the treatment of mania; the role of lithium, lamotrigine, and olanzapine as options for maintenance therapy; and the scarcity of options for the treatment of bipolar depression. Psychoeducation is also supported by most guidelines as an adjunctive treatment.},

Overlooked are Hill's important lessons about how to make decisions based on epidemiologic evidence. He advised epidemiologists to avoid over-emphasizing statistical significance testing, given the observation that systematic error is often greater than random error. His compelling and intuitive examples point out the need to consider costs and benefits when making decisions about health-promoting interventions. These lessons, which offer ways to dramatically increase the contribution of health science to decision making, are as needed today as they were when Hill presented them.},

Girls showed no advantage in g, but performed significantly better on all subjects except Physics. This was not due to their better verbal ability. At age 16, obtaining five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C is an important criterion. 61{\%} of girls and 50{\%} of boys achieved this.

abstract = {Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a powerful tool for noninvasive seizure localization, but it has been underutilized because of practical challenges, including difficulty in implementing ictal-interictal SPECT difference analysis. We previously validated a freely available utility for this purpose, ictal-interictal subtraction analysis by statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (ISAS). To further simplify and improve the difference imaging technique, we now compare a new algorithm, ISAS BioImage Suite (see http://spect.yale.edu and http://bioimagesuite.org), to the original ISAS method in 13 patients with known seizure localization. We found that ISAS BioImage Suite was in agreement with the original algorithm in all cases for which ISAS correctly identified a single unambiguous region of seizure onset. We also tested for possible effects of scan-order bias in the control group used for the analysis and found no significant effect on the results. These findings establish a simple, validated and objective method for analyzing ictal-interictal SPECT difference images for use in the care of patients with epilepsy.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Recommendations of treatment guidelines concerning the use of second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) agents for acute mania vary substantially across committees or working groups. Meta-analyses addressing the use of SGAs in the treatment of acute mania are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of SGAs in the treatment of acute mania. DATA SOURCES: Randomized controlled trials comparing SGAs with placebo, first-generation antipsychotic drugs, or mood stabilizers (MSs) in the treatment of acute mania were searched for in the PsiTri and MEDLINE databases (last search: May 2006). STUDY SELECTION: The abstracts, titles, and index terms of studies were searched using the following key words: aripiprazole, amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, and zotepine in conjunction with mania, manic, and bipolar. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on efficacy, global dropout, dropout due to adverse events, dropout due to inefficacy, weight gain, rate of somnolence, and extrapyramidal symptoms were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 24 studies with 6187 patients were included. The SGAs were significantly more efficacious than placebo. The analysis demonstrated that adding antipsychotic agents to MS treatment was significantly more effective than treatment with MSs alone. The SGAs displayed efficacy comparable with that of MSs. Some SGAs seemed to induce more extrapyramidal symptoms than placebo. The SGAs were also associated with higher rates of somnolence than placebo. CONCLUSION: Currently available data suggest that combining SGAs and MSs is the most efficacious treatment of acute mania.},

@article{Segonne2004,
abstract = {We present a novel skull-stripping algorithm based on a hybrid approach that combines watershed algorithms and deformable surface models. Our method takes advantage of the robustness of the former as well as the surface information available to the latter. The algorithm first localizes a single white matter voxel in a T1-weighted MRI image, and uses it to create a global minimum in the white matter before applying a watershed algorithm with a preflooding height. The watershed algorithm builds an initial estimate of the brain volume based on the three-dimensional connectivity of the white matter. This first step is robust, and performs well in the presence of intensity nonuniformities and noise, but may erode parts of the cortex that abut bright nonbrain structures such as the eye sockets, or may remove parts of the cerebellum. To correct these inaccuracies, a surface deformation process fits a smooth surface to the masked volume, allowing the incorporation of geometric constraints into the skull-stripping procedure. A statistical atlas, generated from a set of accurately segmented brains, is used to validate and potentially correct the segmentation, and the MRI intensity values are locally re-estimated at the boundary of the brain. Finally, a high-resolution surface deformation is performed that accurately matches the outer boundary of the brain, resulting in a robust and automated procedure. Studies by our group and others outperform other publicly available skull-stripping tools. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The present study investigated whether individual differences in the WM structure of normal subjects as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) values correlate with cognitive performance in terms of sustained attention and working memory. Subjects underwent DTI and performed the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and N-back task. FA values throughout the brain were correlated with behavioral performance on a voxel-by-voxel basis to investigate relationships between WM microstructure and cognitive function. The discriminability index of CPT correlated positively with FA of the right cingulum. Accuracy of the 2-back task correlated positively with FA in bilateral cerebellar peduncles. WM microstructure of the right cingulum and bilateral cerebellar peduncles appears related to cognitive function such as sustained attention and working memory in the human brain. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Inevitably, they represent only a thin slice of the work going on in psychiatric ethics. But they serve to show two unique features of this discipline. First, it has a tendency to dig deep and to make connections with other philosophical concepts. So, for example, in a number of ways the papers that follow touch on the nature of personhood. We examine this notion. Second, psychiatric ethics, because of its content and its embededness in the real world, tends to hit upon diverse and sometimes conflicting values. We introduce the idea of values-based medicine, which provides both a theoretical framework and a practical approach to the common dilemmas of psychiatric practice. The need to think deeply, but also clearly and coherently, combined with the need to engage with the hurly-burly of the world of patients, users and carers, suggests the reasons why psychiatric ethics offers a paradigm for practical ethics generally.},

It is timely to reconsider the nosology of this disorder, assessing whether changes to diagnostic criteria as well as subtypes and specifiers may improve diagnostic validity and clinical utility. Methods: The existing criteria were evaluated. Key issues were identified. Electronic databases of PubMed, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO were searched for relevant studies. Results: This review presents a number of options and preliminary recommendations to be considered for DSM-V. These include: (1) clarifying and simplifying the definition of obsessions and compulsions (criterion A); (2) possibly deleting the requirement that people recognize that their obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (criterion B); (3) rethinking the clinical significance criterion (criterion C) and, in the interim, possibly adjusting what is considered "time-consuming" for OCD; (4) listing additional disorders to help with the differential diagnosis (criterion D); (5) rethinking the medical exclusion criterion (criterion E) and clarifying what is meant by a "general medical condition"; (6) revising the specifiers (i.e., clarifying that OCD can involve a range of insight, in addition to "poor insight," and adding "tic-related OCD"); and (7) highlighting in the DSM-V text important clinical features of OCD that are not currently mentioned in the criteria (e.g., the major symptom dimensions). Conclusions: A number of changes to the existing diagnostic criteria for OCD are proposed. These proposed criteria may change as the DSM-V process progresses. Depression and Anxiety 0:1-21, 2010.

abstract = {Purpose – When researchers find an association between two variables, it is useful to evaluate the role of other constructs in this association. While assessing these mediation effects, it is important to determine if results are equal for different groups. It is possible that the strength of a mediation effect may differ for males and females, for example – such an effect is known as moderated mediation. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Participants were 2,532 adolescents from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds and equally distributed across gender. The goal of this study was to investigate parental respect as a potential mediator of the relationship between gender and delinquency and mental health, and to determine whether observed mediation is moderated by gender. Findings – Parental respect mediated the association between gender and both delinquency and mental health. Specifically, parental respect was a protective factor against delinquency and mental health probl...},

abstract = {The development of widely used interview tools has helped to standardize the criteria for a "clinical high risk" syndrome, thus enabling advances in efforts to develop interventions for this phase of illness. These assessments, however, are burdensome to administer and not likely to be adopted for widespread use. Scalable early intervention depends on the availability of brief, low-cost assessment tools that can serve to screen populations of interest or triage treatment-seekers toward specialized care. The current study examines the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive strength of three self-report measures (Prime Screen-Revised, Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief, and Youth Psychosis at Risk Questionnaire-Brief) with regard to psychosis onset and symptom persistence over six months of follow-up within an indicated sample of 54 adolescents and young adults ages 12-22. Within this sample, all three measures demonstrated excellent sensitivity to emerging psychosis and strong agreement with clinician evaluations of attenuated psychosis symptoms. Additionally, all screeners obtained negative predictive values of 1.00 with regard to psychosis onset, indicating that an individual scoring below the recommended threshold score would be extremely unlikely to develop psychosis over the following six months. The longitudinal validation of psychosis risk screening tools constitutes an important step toward establishing a standard of care for early identification and monitoring in this vulnerable population.},

We review the evidence of different theories of increased comorbidity, organized according to four general models: common factor models, secondary substance use disorder models, secondary psychiatric disorder models, and bidirectional models. Among common factor models, evidence suggests that antisocial personality disorder accounts for some increased comorbidity. Among secondary substance use disorder models, there is support for the supersensitivity model, which posits that biological vulnerability of psychiatric disorders results in sensitivity to small amounts of alcohol and drugs, leading to substance use disorders. There is minimal support for the self-medication model, but the accumulation of multiple risk factors related to mental illness, including dysphoria, may increase the risk of substance use disorder. Secondary psychiatric disorder models remain to be convincingly demonstrated. Bidirectional models have not been systematically examined. Further clarification of etiologic factors, including the identification of subtypes of dual diagnosis, may have implications for developing more effective prevention efforts and treatment.},

abstract = {The culmination of several years of collaborative effort among eating disorders investigators from around the world, Developing an Evidence-Based Classification of Eating Disorders: Scientific Findings for DSM-5 provides summaries of the research presentations and discussions of the conceptual and methodological issues involved in diagnosing and classifying eating disorders. The mission of the DSM-5 Eating Disorder Work Group was to improve the clinical utility of eating disorder diagnoses by recommending revisions based on sound empirical evidence. Although the objective was to provide empirical information to the DSM-5 Eating Disorders Work Group, the research presented in this book should be invaluable to the eating disorders research and clinical community at large and, by extension, to their patients.Eating disorders are serious, difficult to treat, and often lead to multiple medical complications, high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, and mortality. It is critical, then, that clinicians be aware of the most current research, as well as understand the foundation of the soon-to-be-released DSM-5.Improving the definition of symptoms and syndromes is one of the critical challenges the authors tackle-in particular the validity of the eating disorders not otherwise specified category, into which 60{\{}{\%}{\}} of patients diagnosed with an eating disorder now fall. In addition, other mental disorders, particularly mood disorders and anxiety disorders, co-occur at a higher rate than would be expected. These findings indicate the need for greater specificity in the nosology, an issue which the investigators address. Other topics addressed include: Eating disorders in children and adolescents, including diagnostic differences and classification. Also included is a chapter on the validity of applying a classification for feeding disorders in infants and young children, as well as one that covers latent profile analysis to identify eating disorder phenotypes in the adolescent population. Cultural considerations and cross-cultural variation in the classification of eating disorders, including Native American, Japanese, Canadian, and Pacific Fijian populations. A discussion of non-fat-phobic anorexia nervosa and its suitability for inclusion in DSM-5. Current and future directions for the assessment of the cognitive criteria for anorexia nervosa. A chapter on loss of control eating, including implications for future weight gain, depression, binge drinking, and substance abuse. Key terms, references, summaries, charts, tables, and other illustrative features are abundant and assist the reader in understanding the research and putting it in context. Developing an Evidence-Based Classification of Eating Disorders: Scientific Findings for DSM-5 is required reading for both investigators and clinicians in the rapidly evolving field of eating disorders.},

AIMS: To describe the national variation in depression symptoms and syndrome prevalence across ten European countries. METHOD: The EURO-D was administered to cross-sectional nationally representative samples of non-institutionalised persons aged {\textgreater} or =50 years (n=22 777). The effects of age, gender, education and cognitive functioning on individual symptoms and EURO-D factor scores were estimated. Country-specific depression prevalence rates and mean factor scores were re-estimated, adjusted for these compositional effects. RESULTS: The prevalence of all symptoms was higher in the Latin ethno-lingual group of countries, especially symptoms related to motivation. Women scored higher on affective suffering; older people and those with impaired verbal fluency scored higher on motivation. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of individual EURO-D symptoms and of probable depression (cut-off score {\textgreater} or =4) varied consistently between countries. Standardising for effects of age, gender, education and cognitive function suggested that these compositional factors did not account for the observed variation.},

The concept of “cognitive dysmetria” has been introduced to characterize disintegration of fronto-thalamic-cerebellar circuitry which constitutes a key network for a variety of neuropsychological symptoms in schizophrenia. The present multimodal study aimed at investigating effective and structural connectivity of the fronto-thalamic circuitry in schizophrenia. fMRI effective connectivity analysis using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were combined to examine cognitive control processes in 38 patients with schizophrenia and 40 matched healthy controls. Significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was detected in patients in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), the right thalamus and the right corpus callosum. During Stroop task performance patients demonstrated significantly lower activation relative to healthy controls in a predominantly right lateralized fronto-thalamo-cerebellar network. An abnormal effective connectivity was observed in the right connections between thalamus, anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. FA in the ALIC was significantly correlated with the thalamic BOLD signal, cognitive performance and fronto-thalamic effective connectivity in patients. Present data provide evidence for the notion of a structural and functional defect in the fronto-thalamo-cerebellar circuitry, which may be the basis of specific cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms mediating hypercortisolemia in depression remain controversial. Adopting the biomarker strategy, we studied adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol dynamics in hypercortisolemic and non-hypercortisolemic depressed in-patients, and in normal volunteers. METHOD: Deconvolution analysis of 24-h pulsatile secretion, approximate entropy (ApEn) estimation of secretory regularity, cross-ApEn quantitation of forward and reverse ACTH-cortisol synchrony, and cosine regression of 24-h rhythmicity. RESULTS: Hypercortisolemia was strongly associated with melancholic and psychotic depressive subtypes. Hypercortisolemic patients had elevated ACTH and cortisol secretion, mediated chiefly by increased burst masses. Basal ACTH secretion was increased, ACTH half-life was reduced, and mean 24-h ACTH concentration was normal. Cortisol secretion was increased in a highly irregular pattern (high ApEn), with high ACTH --{\textgreater} cortisol cross-ApEn (impaired feedforward coupling). Cortisol-mediated feedback on the secretory pattern of ACTH was normal. Hypercortisolemic depressed patients had normal programming of the central hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis pulse generator: ACTH pulse frequency, cortisol pulse frequency, circadian acrophases, and ApEn of ACTH secretion were normal. Responsiveness of the adrenal cortex to endogenous ACTH was normal. Non-hypercortisolemic patients resembled hypercortisolemic patients on ACTH regulatory parameters but had low total cortisol secretion. CONCLUSION: Increased ACTH secretion occurs in depressed in-patients regardless of cortisolemic status, confirming central HPA axis overdrive in severe depression. Depressive hypercortisolemia results from an additional change in the adrenal cortex that causes ACTH-independent, disorderly basal cortisol release, a sign of physiological stress in melancholic/psychotic depression.},

We review the data establishing the use of clonazepam in the treatment of PD as well as new information, particularly confirmation of longterm efficacy and safety. We also discuss a regimen for safely tapered withdrawal of clonazepam, the characteristics of the respiratory subtype of PD, and CO2-induced panic attacks as a diagnostic measure and predictor for therapeutic success. It has been shown that panic attacks can more readily be induced by CO2 in PD patients with the respiratory subtype than those with the non-respiratory subtype. More than 25 years after the first report of efficacy in PD in 1984, clonazepam, alone or combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or behavioral therapy, remains an important therapeutic modality for the management of PD},

abstract = {The development of the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-the DSM-5-has reenergised and driven further forward critical discourse about the place and role of diagnosis in mental health. The DSM-5 has attracted considerable criticism, not least about its role in processes of medicalisation. This paper suggests the need for a sociology of psychiatric critique. Sociological analysis can help map fields of contention, and cast fresh light on the assumptions and nuances of debate around the DSM-5; it underscores the importance of diagnosis to the governance of social and clinical life, as well as the wider discourses critical commentaries connect with and are activated by. More normatively, a sociology of critique can indicate which interests and values are structuring the dialogues being articulated, and just how diverse clinical opinion regarding the DSM can actually be. This has implications for the considerations of health services and policy decision-makers who might look to such debates for guidance.},

abstract = {The localization or representation of mental abilities in the brain have always been considered as key questions for understanding the organization of the human nervous system. Particularly with the advent of modern electrophysiological and imaging techniques that provide maps of electromagnetic fields and metabolic processes on the living central nervous system, the representation theory is experiencing a scientific renaissance in neurology, but is only one theory, however, in the succession of a long philosophical tradition dealing with the possible identification of mental phenomena and brain processes. This dichotomy was formulated at the latest in the Cartesian dualism of res cogitans and res extensa of the mind-body problem. Nowadays philosophical discussion, on the contrary, is dominated by monistic concepts that attempt to explain the mental realm on an organic foundation in order not to succumb to the problem of a psychophysical dualism. Of these, the identity theory offers a philosophically plausible concept postulating that the identity of brain conditions and mental phenomena is based on organic foundations. In this theory, the efforts of brain research converge on the representations of mental phenomena in the human nervous system. In a comprehensive approach, both concepts could complement each other.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In developing psychosocial approaches to augment outcomes for medication-treated adults with ADHD, it is important to understand what types of life-impairments are most affected by continued ADHD symptoms that occur despite medication treatment. This may assist in delineating targets for interventions, as well as assessments of functional outcomes that are sensitive to change in this population. METHOD: The sample consists of 105 adults with ADHD presenting for entry into clinical trials of CBT for residual ADHD. Life impairments are rated by a clinician using the LIFE-RIFT, which has subscales for work impairment, interpersonal impairment, life-satisfaction, and recreation, ADHD symptoms using the ADHD Rating Scale, overall ADHD severity using the clinical global impression, and associated distress using the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales. RESULTS: The most problematic impairments are in the domain of work, followed by interpersonal. Generally, the subscales of the LIFE-RIFT are associated, at the bivariate level, with all 4 symptom indices. Work and interpersonal impairments are uniquely associated with overall severity of ADHD symptoms using both the CGI and the ADHD Rating Scale. However interpersonal and life-satisfaction impairments are uniquely associated with depression, and life-satisfaction is uniquely associated with anxiety. CONCLUSION: In medication-treated adults with ADHD, work and interpersonal impairments appear to be the most problematic areas of life-impairment, which are uniquely associated with ADHD severity. Life-satisfaction appears to be uniquely associated with distress as defined by anxiety and depression symptoms, with interpersonal impairments also playing a role. Psychosocial treatments for medication treated adults should target work and interpersonal domains and should include skills for managing associated distress.},

The shape of the brain is highly dependent on genetic factors as well. All these properties have made brain morphometry one of the most studied modalities in brain imaging. There are several metrics that one can use to test a morphometry-related hypothesis such as gray matter volume, white matter volume, cortical thickness, or cortical curvature. This talk will describe two techniques for analyzing brain morphometry: voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based analysis (SBA).},

If someone is said to have a mental illness, what about it is mental? What makes it an illness? How might we explain and classify it? A system of psychiatric classification settles these questions by distinguishing the mental illnesses and showing how they stand in relation to one another. This book explores the philosophical issues raised by the project of explaining and classifying mental illness. Murphy argues that the current literature on mental illness -- exemplified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- is an impediment to research; it lacks a coherent concept of the mental and a satisfactory account of disorder, and yields too much authority to commonsense thought about the mind. He argues that the explanation of mental illness should meet the standards of good explanatory practice in the cognitive neurosciences, and that the classification of mental disorders should group symptoms into conditions based on the causal structure of the normal mind.},

abstract = {More than 10 years prior to the anticipated 2013 publication of DSM-5, processes were set in motion to assess the research and clinical issues that would best inform future diagnostic classification of mental disorders. These efforts intended to identify the clinical and research needs within various populations, examine the current state of the science to determine the empirical evidence for improving criteria within and across disorders, and stimulate research in areas that could potentially provide evidence for change. In the second phase of the revision process, the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE) recently completed the 5-year international series of 13 diagnostic conferences convened by APA/APIRE in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under a cooperative grant funded by the NIH. From these conferences, the DSM-5 Task Force and Work Groups have developed plans for potential revisions for DSM-5, including the incorporation of dimensional approaches within and across diagnostic groups to clarify heterogeneity, improve diagnostic validity, and enhance clinical case conceptualization. Use of dimensions for measurement-based care has been shown to be feasible in psychiatric and primary care settings and may inform monitoring of disorder threshold, severity, and treatment outcomes. The integration of dimensions with diagnostic categories represents an exciting and potentially transformative approach for DSM-5 to simultaneously address DSM-IV's clinical short-comings and create novel pathways for research in neurobiology, genetics, and psychiatric epidemiology.},

abstract = {Objective: International research programs have contributed to the creation of operationally defined criteria to identify individuals at risk for schizophrenia. Although there has been substantial progress in the prospective study of the schizophrenia prodrome, the utility of current diagnostic criteria remains questionable because of the relatively low base rates of incident psychoses, the high false-positive rate and ethical concerns regarding the treatment of individuals at risk. The identification of brain based neurocognitive vulnerability markers for schizophrenia may contribute to the development of an at risk algorithm with greater predictive accuracy. Methods: Forty subjects at risk (AR) for schizophrenia, 15 in their first episode (FE) of schizophrenia, and 36 healthy comparison (HC) subjects were administered a neurocognitive battery that assessed the domains of processing speed, working memory, verbal episodic memory, executive functioning and general intelligence. Results: At baseline, AR subjects showed neurocognitive deficits across all domains compared to HC subjects that were less severe than those observed in the FE sample. In preliminary analyses, AR subjects who later converted to psychosis (N = 5) had greater neurocognitive impairment at baseline evaluation compared to those individuals who remained "at risk" at follow-up. Conclusions: Neurocognitive deficits may be important in the pathogenesis of early psychosis and could help to define individuals at greatest risk for schizophrenia. Continued research in larger cohorts is needed to test the validity of this neurocognitive profile and its utility as a vulnerability marker. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The 494 controls (65.1{\%} of the sample) had reported using cannabis "never" or "once or twice" at both ages; cannabis users by age 18 (236; 31.1{\%}) first reported using cannabis "three times or more" at age 18; and cannabis users by age 15 (29; 3.8{\%}) had reported using cannabis "three times or more" at age 15 (all of whom continued to use cannabis at age 18). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that cannabis users by age 15 and by age 18 had more schizophrenia symptoms than controls at age 26. These results remained significant after psychotic symptoms at age 11 were controlled for. The effect was stronger with earlier use. Logistic regression analyses showed that people who used cannabis by age 15 were 4 times as likely to have a diagnosis of SZD at age 26 than controls. After psychotic symptoms at age 11 were controlled for, the risk for adult SZD remained higher among those who used cannabis at age 15; however, this risk was reduced by 31{\%} and was no longer significant.

Mental health diagnoses invariably lower the individual's reputation in the eyes of the community. At the same time, DSM diagnoses are but one out of a myriad of possible interpretive frameworks. DSM descriptors for the client's distress thus cannot be said to capture the essence of the client's personhood. When a diagnosis is published as if it captured a definitive truth about an individual psychiatric client, it is, in that important regard, inaccurate. That is, such a communication meets the criterion for a reckless disregard for the truth or an honest belief but without reasonable basis insofar as it is considered to be anything more than a working hypothesis.

abstract = {How does science work? Does it tell us what the world is "really" like? What makes it different from other ways of understanding the universe? In Theory and Reality, Peter Godfrey-Smith addresses these questions by taking the reader on a grand tour of one hundred years of debate about science. The result is a completely accessible introduction to the main themes of the philosophy of science. Intended for undergraduates and general readers with no prior background in philosophy, Theory and Reality covers logical positivism; the problems of induction and confirmation; Karl Popper's theory of science; Thomas Kuhn and "scientific revolutions"; the views of Imre Lakatos, Larry Laudan, and Paul Feyerabend; and challenges to the field from sociology of science, feminism, and science studies. The book then looks in more detail at some specific problems and theories, including scientific realism, the theory-ladeness of observation, scientific explanation, and Bayesianism. Finally, Godfrey-Smith defends a form of philosophical naturalism as the best way to solve the main problems in the field. Throughout the text he points out connections between philosophical debates and wider discussions about science in recent decades, such as the infamous "science wars." Examples and asides engage the beginning student; a glossary of terms explains key concepts; and suggestions for further reading are included at the end of each chapter. However, this is a textbook that doesn't feel like a textbook because it captures the historical drama of changes in how science has been conceived over the last one hundred years. Like no other text in this field, Theory and Reality combines a survey of recent history of the philosophy of science with current key debates in language that any beginning scholar or critical reader can follow.},

abstract = {In German criminal law, intention is the label used not only for cases of knowledge and desire; it also includes cases of what the common law would call recklessness. German criminal law calls its approximation of recklessness dolus eventualis. It is on that concept that the article concentrates. After a brief review of the historical development of the German concept of intention, the author shows that dolus eventualis consists of two components: the cognitive element, which (as in the common law) considers the state of the accused's knowledge that the offence may occur, and a volitional or dispositional element which is unknown to the common law. The author concludes that the volitional or dispositional element is not plausible, and that in any harmonization of concepts of intention in the criminal law of the European countries such an element should not be adopted.},

In an international sample of 5,635 patients with major depressive episodes (Bridge Study), DSM-IV criteria for hypomania (stem questions, number and quality of symptoms, duration and exclusion criteria) were systematically assessed and their validity analysed on the basis of clinical data including family history, course, and other clinical characteristics. Three stem questions for hypomania, irritability, elevated mood and the added question of increased activity, showed comparable validity. The results support the current DSM-IV requirement for a higher symptom threshold (4 of 7 hypomanic symptoms) in cases of irritable mood. Longer durations of hypomanic episodes were associated with higher scores on all validators. The results did not support the DSM-IV durational requirements for hypomanic episodes (4 days) and manic episodes (7 days). Brief hypomanic episodes of 1, 2 or 3 days were valid and would meet validity criteria for inclusion. The three exclusion criteria in DSM-IV (hypomania due to the use of antidepressants or of other substances, or to other medical conditions) were found to exclude patients with bipolar depression and should therefore not be retained. These results support several revisions of the DSM-IV concept of hypomanic episodes: specifically, the inclusion of increased activity as a gate question, the inclusion of 1 or 2 to 3-day episodes and the elimination of all exclusion criteria.},

abstract = {Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease entity for the past century, its definitions and boundaries have continued to vary over this period. At any given time, the changing concept of schizophrenia has been influenced by available diagnostic tools and treatments, related conditions from which it most needs to be distinguished, extant knowledge and scientific paradigms. There is significant heterogeneity in the etiopathology, symptomatology, and course of schizophrenia. It is characterized by an admixture of positive, negative, cognitive, mood, and motor symptoms whose severity varies across patients and through the course of the illness. Positive symptoms usually first begin in adolescence or early adulthood, but are often preceded by varying degrees of negative and cognitive symptomatology. Schizophrenia tends to be a chronic and relapsing disorder with generally incomplete remissions, variable degrees of functional impairment and social disability, frequent comorbid substance abuse, and decreased longevity. Although schizophrenia may not represent a single disease with a unitary etiology or pathogenetic process, alternative approaches have thus far been unsuccessful in better defining this syndrome or its component entities. The symptomatologic, course, and etio-pathological heterogeneity can usefully be addressed by a dimensional approach to psychopathology, a clinical staging approach to illness course, and by elucidating endophenotypes and markers of illness progression, respectively. This will allow an approach to the deconstruction of schizophrenia into its multiple component parts and strategies to reconfigure these components in a more meaningful manner. Possible implications for DSM-V and ICD-11 definitions of schizophrenia are discussed.},

This conclusion is based on the following arguments: if the coupling among an ensemble of dynamical systems is mediated by short-range forces, then the states of remote systems must be conditionally independent. These independencies induce a Markov blanket that separates internal and external states in a statistical sense. The existence of a Markov blanket means that internal states will appear to minimize a free energy functional of the states of their Markov blanket. Crucially, this is the same quantity that is optimized in Bayesian inference. Therefore, the internal states (and their blanket) will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference. In other words, they will appear to model-and act on-their world to preserve their functional and structural integrity, leading to homoeostasis and a simple form of autopoiesis.},

abstract = {In historical and epistemological terms, psychiatry is a new discipline born during the 19th century. Rooted in both the natural and social sciences, psychiatric objects of inquiry, namely mental symptoms and mental disorders, are hybrid, constituted by the blending of components arising from disparate sources of knowledge ranging from the biological to the semantic in its widest sense. This poses problems for psychiatric research and therapy. Whilst conventional pluralism may be a convenient approach to manage aspects of psychiatric practice, it lacks the capacity to analyse psychiatric objects in their entirety. For the latter, psychiatry demands a new, tailored regional epistemology. This paper outlines the main features of an epistemology specific to the needs of psychiatry. It highlights the relational approach that needs to be taken and illustrates the usefulness of this approach by analysing the structure of psychiatric objects, exploring the manner in which they may be inscribed in the brain, and identifying the need to periodically recalibrate the language of psychiatry.},

His theories, however, did not arise de novo, being strongly influenced by Karl Kahlbaum and Ewald Hecker. From the 1860–1880s, they articulated a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of psychiatric diagnosis, from symptom-based syndromes, popular since the late 18th century, to proto-disease entities. This effort was influenced by parallel developments in general medicine, especially the rise of bacterial theories of disease where different syndromes had distinctive symptoms, courses, and etiologies. Their thinking was particularly shaped by the increasing understanding of general paresis of the insane. Indeed, this disorder, with its distinct course and characteristic symptoms, was paradigmatic for them. Their hope was that a similar progression of medical understanding would evolve for the other major psychiatric syndromes. Their thinking and its connection with Kraepelin's noso...},

Unlike older forms of philosophy of mind, contemporary analytical philosophy is not exclusively based on introspection and conceptual analysis, but also draws upon the empirical methods and findings of the sciences. This article outlines the conceptual framework of the "mind-body problem" as formulated in contemporary analytical philosophy and argues that this philosophical debate has potentially far-reaching implications for psychiatry as a clinical-scientific discipline, especially for its own autonomy and its relationship to neurology/neuroscience. This point is illustrated by a conceptual analysis of the five principles formulated in Kandel's 1998 article "A New Intellectual Framework for Psychiatry." Kandel's position in the philosophical mind-body debate is ambiguous, ranging from reductive physicalism (psychophysical identity theory) to non-reductive physicalism (in which the mental "supervenes" on the physical) to epiphenomenalist dualism or even emergent dualism. We illustrate how these diverging interpretations result in radically different views on the identity of psychiatry and its relationship with the rapidly expanding domain of neurology/neuroscience.},

abstract = {Clinical trials today are conducted in multiple countries to enhance patient recruitment and improve efficiency of trials. However, the demographic and cultural diversity may contribute to variations in study outcomes. Here we conducted post-hoc analyses for a placebo-controlled study with ziprasidone and haloperidol for the treatment of acute mania to address the demographic, dosing, and outcome disparities in India, Russia and the USA. We compared the baseline characteristics, outcomes and discontinuations in patients and explored the relationship between the outcome measures across these countries. We found substantial differences in baseline characteristics of subjects, administered dosage and disease severity in India compared to the USA and Russia. Conversely, US subjects had a higher placebo response compared to subjects in Russia and India. These results are probably due to demographic differences in patient populations and psychiatric clinical practice across countries. While we offer initial ideas to address the disparities identified in this analysis, it is clear that further research to improve our understanding of geographical differences is essential to ensure globally applicable results for clinical trials in psychiatry.},

Methods: Studies were selected from articles dated between January 1991 and June 2010 extracted from the Medline, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Results: The final analysis consisted of 15 studies, distributed as follows: (i) four corresponded to hospitalized patients, totaling 299 individuals, and found a prevalence of CSDS varying between 20{\%} and 56{\%}; (ii) four corresponded to outpatients, totaling 1,454 individuals, and the prevalence of CSDS varied between 11{\%} and 65{\%}, and the prevalence of MDD varied between 23{\%} and 42{\%}; and (iii) seven corresponded to elderly individuals residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF), totaling 839 individuals, and the prevalence of CSDS varied between 11{\%} and 65{\%}. Conclusion: The present review indicated a higher prevalence of both MDD and CSDS among elderly brazilians assisted at healthcare facilities.},

abstract = {The term "schizophrenia" was coined in April 1908, when Paul Eugen Bleuler gave a lecture at a meeting of the German Psychiatric Association in Berlin. At that meeting, Bleuler used the word schizophrenia to revised the Kraepelinian concept of dementia praecox. Bleuler realized that the condition was not a single disease, was not invariable incurable, and did not always progress to full dementia, nor did it always and only occur in young people. Thus, he challenged the accepted wisdom of the time and advanced his purportedly less static and stigmatizing concept by employing a term that related what Bleuler considered the most important sign of disease: the splitting (or schizen in Greek) of different psychological functions and loss of personality unity (denoted as phren, originally denoting diaphragm but later changing to "soul, spirit, mind.")

abstract = {An emerging class of theories concerning the functional structure of the brain takes the reuse of neural circuitry for various cognitive purposes to be a central organizational principle. According to these theories, it is quite common for neural circuits established for one purpose to be exapted (exploited, recycled, redeployed) during evolution or normal development, and be put to different uses, often without losing their original functions. Neural reuse theories thus differ from the usual understanding of the role of neural plasticity (which is, after all, a kind of reuse) in brain organization along the following lines: According to neural reuse, circuits can continue to acquire new uses after an initial or original function is established; the acquisition of new uses need not involve unusual circumstances such as injury or loss of established function; and the acquisition of a new use need not involve (much) local change to circuit structure (e.g., it might involve only the establishment of functional connections to new neural partners). Thus, neural reuse theories offer a distinct perspective on several topics of general interest, such as: the evolution and development of the brain, including (for instance) the evolutionary-developmental pathway supporting primate tool use and human language; the degree of modularity in brain organization; the degree of localization of cognitive function; and the cortical parcellation problem and the prospects (and proper methods to employ) for function to structure mapping. The idea also has some practical implications in the areas of rehabilitative medicine and machine interface design.},

abstract = {This article reviews our understanding of reading disorders in children and relates it to current proposals for their classification in DSM-5. There are two different, commonly occurring, forms of reading disorder in children which arise from different underlying language difficulties. Dyslexia (as defined in DSM-5), or decoding difficulty, refers to children who have difficulty in mastering the relationships between the spelling patterns of words and their pronunciations. These children typically read aloud inaccurately and slowly, and experience additional problems with spelling. Dyslexia appears to arise principally from a weakness in phonological (speech sound) skills, and there is good evidence that it can be ameliorated by systematic phonic teaching combined with phonological awareness training. The other major form of reading difficulty is reading comprehension impairment. These children read aloud accurately and fluently, but have difficulty understanding what they have read. Reading comprehension impairment appears to arise from weaknesses in a range of oral language skills including poor vocabulary knowledge, weak grammatical skills and difficulties in oral language comprehension. We suggest that the omission of reading comprehension impairment from DSM-5 is a serious one that should be remedied. Both dyslexia and reading comprehension impairment are dimensional in nature, and show strong continuities with other disorders of language. We argue that recognizing the continuities between reading and language disorders has important implications for assessment and treatment, and we note that the high rates of comorbidity between reading disorders and other seemingly disparate disorders (including ADHD and motor disorders) raises important challenges for understanding these disorders.},

abstract = {The objective of the study was to identify whether there are consistent regional white matter changes in schizophrenia. A systematic search was conducted for voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy studies of patients with schizophrenia (or related disorders) in relation to comparison groups. The authors carried out meta-analysis of the co-ordinates of fractional anisotropy differences. For the meta-analysis they used the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method hybridized with the rank approach used in Genome Scan Meta-Analysis (GSMA). This system detects three-dimensional conjunctions of co-ordinates from multiple studies and permits the weighting of studies in relation to sample size. Fifteen articles were identified for inclusion in the meta-analysis, including a total of 407 patients with schizophrenia and 383 comparison subjects. The studies reported fractional anisotropy reductions at 112 co-ordinates in schizophrenia and no fractional anisotropy increases. Over all studies, significant reductions were present in two regions: the left frontal deep white matter and the left temporal deep white matter. The first region, in the left frontal lobe, is traversed by white matter tracts interconnecting the frontal lobe, thalamus and cingulate gyrus. The second region, in the temporal lobe, is traversed by white matter tracts interconnecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus-amygdala, temporal and occipital lobe. This suggests that two networks of white matter tracts may be affected in schizophrenia, with the potential for 'disconnection' of the gray matter regions which they link. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although we have studied schizophrenia as a major disease entity over the past century, its causes and pathogenesis remain obscure. In this article, we critically review genetic and other epidemiological findings and discuss the insights they provide into the causes of schizophrenia. The annual incidence of schizophrenia averages 15 per 100,000, the point prevalence averages approximately 4.5 per population of 1000, and the risk of developing the illness over one's lifetime averages 0.7{\%}. Schizophrenia runs in families and there are significant variations in the incidence of schizophrenia, with urbanicity, male gender, and a history of migration being associated with a higher risk for developing the illness. Genetic factors and gene-environment interactions together contribute over 80{\%} of the liability for developing schizophrenia and a number of chromosomal regions and genes have been "linked" to the risk for developing the disease. Despite intensive research and spectacular advances in molecular biology, however, no single gene variation has been consistently associated with a greater likelihood of developing the illness and the precise nature of the genetic contribution remains obscure at this time. Environmental factors linked to a higher likelihood of developing schizophrenia include cannabis use, prenatal infection or malnutrition, perinatal complications, and a history of winter birth; the exact relevance or nature of these contributions is, however, unclear. How various genetic and environmental factors interact to cause schizophrenia and via which precise neurobiological mechanisms they mediate this effect is not understood. Etiological heterogeneity, complex patterns of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction, and inadequately elucidated schizophrenia pathophysiology are among the explanations invoked to explain our inadequate understanding of the etio-pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The ability to question some of our basic assumptions about the etiology and nature of schizophrenia and greater rigor in its study appear critical to improving our understanding about its causation.},

abstract = {This article traces the fundamental descriptive features of schizophrenia described in the European continental literature form Kraepelin and Bleuler, culminating with the creation of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8 (1974). There was a consensus among the researchers that the specificity and typicality of schizophrenia was anchored to its "fundamental" clinical core (with trait status) and not to positive psychotic features, which were considered as "state", "accessory" phenomena. The clinical core of schizophrenia was, in a diluted form, constitutive of the spectrum conditions ("schizoidia" and "latent schizophrenia"). The fundamental features are manifest across all domains of consciousness: subjective experience, expression, cognition, affectivity, behavior, and willing. Yet, the specificity of the core was only graspable at a more comprehensive Gestalt-level, variously designated (eg, discordance, autism, "Spaltung"), and not on the level of single features. In other words, the phenomenological specificity was seen as being expressive of a fundamental structural or formal change of the patient's mentality (consciousness, subjectivity). This overall change transpires through the single symptoms and signs, lending them a characteristic phenomenological pattern. This concept of schizophrenia bears little resemblance to the current operational definitions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and ICD-10 seem to diagnose a subset of patients with chronic paranoid-hallucinatory variant of schizophrenia.},

Results indicate that subjects who secrete a greater amplitude of cortisol diurnally demonstrate less brain activation in limbic regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus/parahippocampus, and hypothalamus during exposure to traumatic WTC-related images. Such initial findings can begin to link our understanding, in humans, of the relationship between the diurnal amplitude of a hormone integral to the stress response, and those neuroanatomical regions that are implicated as both modulating and being modulated by that response.},

The present study investigates this hypothesis, using a population cohort that shifts from low to elevated depression levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: We assessed the nine DSM-5 MDD criterion symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9) and seven depression risk factors (personal and family MDD history, sex, childhood stress, neuroticism, work hours, and stressful life events) in a longitudinal study of medical interns prior to and throughout internship (n = 1289). We tested whether risk factors varied across symptoms, and whether a latent disease model could account for heterogeneity between symptoms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All MDD symptoms increased significantly during residency training. Four risk factors predicted increases in unique subsets of PHQ-9 symptoms over time (depression history, childhood stress, sex, and stressful life events), whereas neuroticism and work hours predicted increases in all symptoms, albeit to varying magnitudes. MDD family history did not predict increases in any symptom. The strong heterogeneity of associations persisted after controlling for a latent depression factor.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The influence of risk factors varies substantially across DSM depression criterion symptoms. As symptoms are etiologically heterogeneous, considering individual symptoms in addition to depression diagnosis might offer important insights obfuscated by symptom sum scores.},

METHOD: Subjects were 203 consecutive admissions to an early psychosis program. Assessments included substance use, positive, negative and depressive symptoms and social functioning. Assessments occurred at baseline, and 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-ups. RESULTS: The prevalence of substance misuse was high with 51{\%} having a substance use disorder (SUD), 33{\%} with cannabis SUD and 35{\%} with an alcohol SUD. Numbers with an alcohol SUD declined considerably by 1 year and for cannabis SUD by 2 years. Substance misuse was significantly associated with male gender, young age and age of onset and cannabis misuse with increased positive symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high rates of substance misuse, in particular cannabis, in first-episode psychosis. It further demonstrates that these rates can be reduced.},

abstract = {Nancy Cartwright begins her recent book, Hunting Causes and Using Them, by noting that while a few years ago real causal claims were in dispute, nowadays "causality is back, and with a vengeance." In the case of the social sciences, Keith Morrison writes that "Social science asks 'why?'. Detecting causality or its corollary-prediction-is the jewel in the crown of social science research." With respect to the health sciences, Judea Pearl writes that the "research questions that motivate most studies in the health sciences are causal in nature." However, not all data used by people interested in making causal claims come from experiments that use random assignment to control and treatment groups. Indeed, much research in the social and health science depends on non-experimental, observational data. Thus, one of the most important problems in the social and health sciences concerns making warranted causal claims using non-experimental, observational data; viz., "Can observational data be used to make etiological inferences leading to warranted causal claims?" This paper examines one method of warranting causal claims that is especially widespread in epidemiology and the health sciences generally-the use of causal criteria. It is argued that cases of complex causation generally, and redundant causation-both causal overdetermination and causal preemption-specifically, undermine the use of such criteria to warrant causal claims.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground Individuals with an “Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome” (APS) have a 20–40{\{}{\%}{\}} chance of developing a psychotic disorder within two years; however it is difficult to predict which of them will become ill on the basis of their clinical symptoms alone. We examined whether P50 gating deficits could help to discriminate individuals with APS and also those who are particularly likely to make a transition to psychosis. Method 36 cases meeting PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation) criteria for the APS, all free of antipsychotics, and 60 controls performed an auditory conditioning–testing experiment while their electroencephalogram was recorded. The P50 ratio and its C–T difference were compared between groups. Subjects received follow-up for up to 2 years to determine their clinical outcome. Results The P50 ratio was significantly higher and C–T difference lower in the APS group compared to controls. Of the individuals with APS who completed the follow-up (n = 36), nine (25{\{}{\%}{\}}) developed psychosis. P50 ratio and the C–T difference did not significantly differ between those individuals who developed psychosis and those who did not within the APS group. Conclusion P50 deficits appear to be associated with the pre-clinical phase of psychosis. However, due to the limitations of the study and its sample size, replication in an independent cohort is necessary, to clarify the role of P50 deficits in illness progression and whether this inexpensive and non-invasive EEG marker could be of clinical value in the prediction of psychosis outcomes amongst populations at risk.},

Cortical maps are typically arranged with a topography oriented parallel to the cortical surface. Despite this unambiguous sheetlike geometry, the most commonly used coordinate systems for localizing cortical features are based on 3-D stereotaxic coordinates rather than on position relative to the 2-D cortical sheet. In order to address the need for a more natural surface-based coordinate system for the cortex, we have developed a means for generating an average folding pattern across a large number of individual subjects as a function on the unit sphere and of nonrigidly aligning each individual with the average. This establishes a spherical surface-based coordinate system that is adapted to the folding pattern of each individual subject, allowing for much higher localization accuracy of structural and functional features of the human brain.},

abstract = {To date, research into the biomarker-aided early recognition of psychosis has focused on predicting the transition likelihood of clinically defined individuals with different at-risk mental states (ARMS) based on structural (and functional) brain changes. However, it is currently unknown whether neuroimaging patterns could be identified to facilitate the individualized prediction of symptomatic and functional recovery. Therefore, we investigated whether cortical surface alterations analyzed by means of multivariate pattern recognition methods could enable the single-subject identification of functional outcomes in twenty-seven ARMS individuals. Subjects were dichotomized into 'good' vs. 'poor' outcome groups on average 4years after the baseline MRI scan using a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) threshold of 70. Cortical surface-based pattern classification predicted good (N=14) vs. poor outcome status (N=13) at follow-up with an accuracy of 82{\{}{\%}{\}} as determined by nested leave-one-cross-validation. Neuroanatomical prediction involved cortical area reductions in superior temporal, inferior frontal and inferior parietal areas and was not confounded by functional impairment at baseline, or antipsychotic medication and transition status over the follow-up period. The prediction model's decision scores were correlated with positive and general symptom scores in the ARMS group at follow-up, whereas negative symptoms were not linked to predicted poorer functional outcome. These findings suggest that poorer functional outcomes are associated with non-resolving attenuated psychosis and could be predicted at the single-subject level using multivariate neuroanatomical risk stratification methods. However, the generalizability and specificity of the suggested prediction model should be thoroughly investigated in future large-scale and cross-diagnostic MRI studies.},

{\textgreater} The experts respond to the evolving behavior of their patients by changing their conception of the disorder. Expert theory and lay opinion reflect and change one another so that what may appear as a new discovery about a diagnosis relfects not an accumulation of knowledge about people but an expert coming to see that pehavior not formerly characteristic of a kind of person has now become characteristic of them because it has become part of the lay understanding about what people of that sort are like.


{\textgreater} The looping effect of interactive kinds is the first of the two ways we find Hacking thinking about the social causes of mental illness. Mental illness is in this instance a special case of a general form of “social construction,” which is that the way people are classified makes a difference tohowthey behave. This first mechanism of social construction depends on the development of a community of inquir- ers. As something becomes a focus of research in the human sciences, interactive kinds are posited as an aid to inquiry and the looping effect gets another opportunity.},

abstract = {Though still in infancy, the field of psychiatric genetics holds great potential to contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic options to treat these disorders. Among a large number of existing neurotransmitter systems, the serotonin system dysfunction has been implicated in many psychiatric disorders and therapeutic efficacy of many drugs is also thought to be based on modulation of serotonin. Serotonin transporter gene polymorphism is one of the most extensively studied polymorphisms in psychiatric behavioral genetics. In this article, we review the status of evidence for association between the serotonin gene polymorphism and some common mental disorders like affective disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, suicide, autism, and other anxiety and personality disorders. Going beyond traditional association studies, gene-environment interaction, currently gaining momentum, is also discussed in the review. While the existing information of psychiatric genetics is inadequate for putting into practice genetic testing in the diagnostic work-up of the psychiatric patient, if consistent in future research attempts, such results can be of great help to improve the clinical care of a vast majority of patients suffering from such disorders.},

Beginning with a brief historical overview from antiquity to 'anti-psychiatry' and a summary of recent debates, the article then offers two case studies of common diagnoses ('depression' and 'schizophrenia'). The main challenge for social science is no longer about what is wrong with psychiatric diagnosis (that is now well rehearsed) but how to account for how and why it has survived. In answering this question about survival, inter-disciplinary work could attend to the pre-empirical positions of mental health researchers; the ways in which mental disorders are similar and different to physical disorders; and the interest work of different social groups defending or attacking psychiatric diagnoses in varying contexts. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Initially listed as a mental disorder in the official classifications of both the American Psychiatric Association (the DSM system) and the World Health Organization (in the ICD), it is no longer considered to be so. The deletion of homosexuality from the psychiatric nosology was the result of a concatenation of social forces, including political pressure from homosexual organizations, involvement of the wider human rights movement, and epidemiological data that questioned the 'scientific' basis for considering homosexuality simpliciter a mental disorder. At the same time, the current version of the ICD appears to show a somewhat ambivalent attitude, in that it has retained homosexuality within its classification albeit with the instruction 'code homosexuality here whether or not it is considered as a mental disorder'. It can be argued, given that - with one notable exception - homosexuality is not considered a mental disorder in any member country of the World Health Organization, it should no longer be listed in the International classification of diseases.},

I discuss these many applications of the levels metaphor with an eye to developing a descriptively adequate account of one particular application: levels of mechanisms. I argue that this application of the metaphor is central to the explanatory practices of the special sciences and defensible as a metaphysical picture of how phenomena studied in the special sciences are constituted.},

METHODS: A questionnaire was constructed and administered to child and adolescent mental health clinicians working in North East England. RESULTS: Sixty-seven per cent (n=121) of eligible clinicians responded. Almost all the participants believed that young people 'At-Risk' needed support. However, only around half felt confident in identifying this patient group. Approximately a third felt that antipsychotic medication may be useful. Some interprofessional differences were noted in relation to both knowledge and attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Further training would be required for most health workers in this sample to feel confident in identifying the syndrome. These findings require replication in other service settings and may have implications for the implementation of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic category relating to the At-Risk Mental State.},

There are a number of possible causes for this increase; moreover, as the symptoms of depression in the elderly are often difficult to identify and interpret, a diagnosis of depression in the elderly may be difficult to make, particularly when other concomitant pathologies mask the signs and symptoms of this disease. There is thus a need to standardize the various self-rating and hetero-evaluation scales used to differentiate between normal and depressed subjects. These tools are designed to investigate and evaluate the various components of depression in depth. They are essential for the diagnosis and therapy in patients who suffer from mood disorders, though it should be borne in mind that these tests need to be preceded and confirmed by a thorough psychiatric examination.},

Individual tests can be classified according to the degree to which they involve g. Here, regional brain volumes associated with g are investigated by means of structural magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. First, individual differences in the amount of regional gray matter volumes across the entire brain were correlated with eight cognitive tests showing distinguishable g-involvement. Results show that increasing g-involvement of individual tests was associated with increased gray matter volume throughout the brain. Second, it is shown that two prototypical measures of verbal and non-verbal g (i.e., vocabulary and block design) correlate with the amount of regional gray matter across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, suggesting that the general factor of intelligence relates to areas distributed across the brain as opposed to the view that g derives exclusively from the frontal lobes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Reliability was adequate to excellent on four of the dimensions, but only fair on the dimension of bizarreness. In 52 delusional patients, no two dimensions correlated highly with each other, indicating that the dimensions were not redundant. Factor analysis identified two factors from the five dimensions--delusional involvement and delusional construct. On the basis of these results the authors suggest that delusions are a multidimensional phenomenon; the results have implications for the measurement of delusions in clinical research and for the understanding of the structure of psychotic experience.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional meta-analyses have shown inconsistent results for efficacy of pharmacological treatments for acute mania. We did a multiple-treatments meta-analysis, which accounted for both direct and indirect comparisons, to assess the effects of all antimanic drugs. METHODS: We systematically reviewed 68 randomised controlled trials (16 073 participants) from Jan 1, 1980, to Nov 25, 2010, which compared any of the following pharmacological drugs at therapeutic dose range for the treatment of acute mania in adults: aripiprazole, asenapine, carbamazepine, valproate, gabapentin, haloperidol, lamotrigine, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, topiramate, and ziprasidone. The main outcomes were the mean change on mania rating scales and the number of patients who dropped out of the allocated treatment at 3 weeks. Analysis was done by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Haloperidol (standardised mean difference SMD -056 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI -069 to -043), risperidone (-050 -063 to -038), olanzapine (-043 -054 to -032, lithium (-037 -063 to -011), quetiapine (-037 -051 to -023), aripiprazole (-037 -051 to -023), carbamazepine (-036 -060 to -011, asenapine (-030 -053 to -007), valproate (-020 -037 to -004), and ziprasidone (-020 -037 to -003) were significantly more effective than placebo, whereas gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate were not. Haloperidol had the highest number of significant differences and was significantly more effective than lithium (SMD -019 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI -036 to -001), quetiapine (-019 -037 to 001), aripiprazole (-019 -036 to -002), carbamazepine (-020 -036 to -001), asenapine (-026 -052 to 001), valproate (-036 -056 to -015), ziprasidone -036 -056 to -015), lamotrigine (-048 -077 to -019), topiramate (-063 -084 to -043), and gabapentin (-088 -140 to -036). Risperidone and olanzapine had a very similar profile of comparative efficacy, being more effective than valproate, ziprasidone, lamotrigine, topiramate, and gabapentin. Olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine led to significantly fewer discontinuations than did lithium, lamotrigine, placebo, topiramate, and gabapentin. INTERPRETATION: Overall, antipsychotic drugs were significantly more effective than mood stabilisers. Risperidone, olanzapine, and haloperidol should be considered as among the best of the available options for the treatment of manic episodes. These results should be considered in the development of clinical practice guidelines. FUNDING: None.},

abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MD) is a debilitating public mental health problem with severe societal and personal costs attached. Around one in six people will suffer from this complex disorder at some point in their lives, which has shown considerable etiological and clinical heterogeneity. Overall there remain no validated biomarkers in the youth population at large that can aid the detection of at-risk groups for depression in general and for boys and young men in particular. Using repeated measurements of two well-known correlates of MD (self-reported current depressive symptoms and early-morning cortisol), we undertook a population-based investigation to ascertain subtypes of adolescents that represent separate longitudinal phenotypes. Subsequently, we tested for differential risks for MD and other mental illnesses and cognitive differences between subtypes. Through the use of latent class analysis, we revealed a high-risk subtype (17{\%} of the sample) demarcated by both high depressive symptoms and elevated cortisol levels. Membership of this class of individuals was associated with increased levels of impaired autobiographical memory recall in both sexes and the greatest likelihood of experiencing MD in boys only. These previously unidentified findings demonstrate at the population level a class of adolescents with a common physiological biomarker specifically for MD in boys and for a mnemonic vulnerability in both sexes. We suggest that the biobehavioral combination of high depressive symptoms and elevated morning cortisol is particularly hazardous for adolescent boys.},

Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Over the past three decades, there have been significant changes in the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia as well as changes in measurement of IQ. The last quantitative review of the literature on premorbid IQ in schizophrenia was published more than two decades ago. Since that time, there have been many published studies of data sets pertaining to this issue. The purpose of the present review was to provide an updated meta-analysis of premorbid IQ in individuals who later develop schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors performed a systematic literature search, which yielded 18 studies that met criteria for the meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were 1) premorbid psychometric measures of IQ in subjects who were later diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder, 2) similar comparison data, and 3) sufficient data for calculation of an effect size. The analogue to the analysis of variance method was used to model between-study variance due to key study-design features. RESULTS: Overall, schizophrenia samples demonstrated a reliable, medium-sized impairment in premorbid IQ. The heterogeneity of effect sizes was minimal and almost exclusively the result of one study. Methodological differences, such as diagnostic criteria, type of IQ measure, sample ascertainment, and age at premorbid testing, contributed minimally to the effect size variance. A cross-sectional analysis of all studies by age and a descriptive review of studies that used repeated measures of IQ in a single sample did not support the presence of a relative decline in IQ during the premorbid period in individuals with schizophrenia. However, all studies with pre- and post-onset testing within the same sample suggested that a significant decline in the IQ of individuals with schizophrenia, relative to comparison subjects, was associated with the onset of frank psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Years before the onset of psychotic symptoms, individuals with schizophrenia, as a group, demonstrate mean IQ scores approximately one-half of a standard deviation below that of healthy comparison subjects.},

Specifically, we applied this technique to visualize in vivo (i) the superior longitudinal (arcuate) fasciculus, (ii) the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, (iii) the superior fronto-occipital (subcallosal) fasciculus, (iv) the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, (v) the uncinate fasciculus, (vi) the cingulum, (vii) the anterior commissure, (viii) the corpus callosum, (ix) the internal capsule, and (x) the fornix. These fasciculi were first isolated and were then interactively displayed as a 3D-rendered object. The virtual tract maps obtained in vivo using this approach were faithful to the classical descriptions of white matter anatomy that have previously been documented in postmortem studies. Since we have been able to interactively delineate and visualize white matter fasciculi over their entire length in vivo, in a manner that has only previously been possible by histological means, "virtual in vivo interactive dissection" (VIVID) adds a new dimension to anatomical descriptions of the living human brain.},

abstract = {One of the most intriguing frontiers of current neuroscientific research is represented by the investigation of the possible neural substrates of morality. The assumption is that in humans an innate moral sense would exist. If this is true, with no doubt it should be regulated by specific brain mechanisms selected over the course of evolution, as they would promote our species' survival. In the last decade, an increasing number of studies have been carried out to explore the neural bases of human morality.The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the data regarding the neurobiological origin of the moral sense, through a Medline search of English-language articles from 1980 to February 2012.The available findings would suggest that there might be a main integrative centre for the innate morality, in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, with its multiple connections with the limbic lobe, thalamus and brainstem. The subjective moral sense would be the result of an integration of multiple automatic responses, mainly associated with social emotions and interpretation of others' behaviours and intentions.Since converging observations outline how lesions of the proposed neural networks may underlie some personality changes and criminal behaviours, the implications of the studies in this field encompass many areas of the scientific domain.},

Side effect profiles suggest that SSRIs inhibit dopaminergic activity, but mechanistic insight remains scarce. Here we show that in mice, chronic 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) blockade during adulthood but not during development impairs basal ganglia-dependent behaviors in a dose-dependent and reversible fashion. Furthermore, chronic 5-HTT blockade reduces striatal dopamine (DA) content and metabolism. A causal relationship between reduced DA signaling and impaired basal ganglia-dependent behavior is indicated by the reversal of behavioral deficits through L-DOPA administration. Our data suggest that augmentation of DA signaling would reduce side effects and increase efficacies of SSRI-based therapy.},

abstract = {Human genetics researchers have been intrigued for many years by weak-to-moderate associations between markers and diseases. However, in most cases of association, the cause of this phenomenon is still unknown. Recently, interest has grown in pursuing association studies for complex psychiatric diseases, either instead of or in addition to linkage studies. However, it is one thing to detect association; the next important step is to determine why. Here we consider what a disease-marker association in the weak-to-moderate range (relative risk {\textless} 5) can tell us about disease etiology. Two distinct models (not the only possibilities) which could explain such an association are formulated. One is a linkage disequilibrium or major disease gene model, involving tight linkage with a "necessary" major gene. The other is a pure association model, involving a "susceptibility" gene that has only a minor effect on disease state. It will be shown that association analysis cannot distinguish between these two models, and hence cannot elucidate the biological mechanism behind the association. (This statement holds for traditional population-based association tests, as well as for more recent family-based association tests.) The importance of drawing the distinction between these two genetic models and the implications for understanding the genetics of complex human disease will also be discussed.},

abstract = {The DSM-5 list of diagnoses concerning schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders is expected to be revised and graduated from mild to severe. The proposed changes for the diagnosis of schizophrenia affect demands for characteristic symptoms, clarify relation to pervasive developmental disorders, and eliminate the classic subtypes of schizophrenia. A dimensional assessment will be measured on a 0-4 point scale. It is recommended that the concept of attenuated psychosis syndrome is further investigated. The propositions affecting characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia might increase diagnostic reliability and validity, but it is estimated to exclude about 2 {\{}{\%}{\}} of patients currently diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia from fulfilling criteria for DSM-5 schizophrenia. It might generate a problem for future young patients if the changes concerning demands on characteristic symptoms turn out to be more restrictive, leaving out a percentage of patients with psychotic symptoms from a diagnosis of schizophrenia; which in practice opens possibilities for intensive treatment options. On the other hand, not including attenuated psychosis syndrome at the present might protect patients from stigmatization and pharmacological treatment on poor indication. The introduction of dimensional assessments may make schizophrenia subtyping redundant and has the potential to enrich clinical practice and bridge communication between child and adolescent and adult psychiatry. The most recent guidelines for assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia are from 2001. They provide differentiated recommendations regarding diagnostics, assessment of symptoms and functioning and treatment strategies. There is an urgent need for updated guidelines in this field, especially concerning specific treatment guidelines.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the official proposals for the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual (DSM-5) is to provide a dimensional model in which 37 traits are included within six broad domains. One of the more important traits within this model is histrionism because another proposal for DSM-5 is to delete the histrionic diagnostic category. The only way to recover histrionic traits in DSM-5 will be through the dimensional model. Histrionism, though, is included within the domain of antagonism of this dimensional model, despite the fact that previous research has consistently placed histrionic personality disorder within extraversion. The current study tests empirically whether histrionic personality traits are optimally placed within the domain of extraversion or antagonism through tests involving seven alternative measures of histrionic personality disorder, five scales to assess the DSM-5 components of histrionism, 10 measures of various histrionic personality traits and two alternative measures of extraversion. The results of the study provide support for placing histrionism within antagonism and clarify the inconsistency of the DSM-5 placement with the existing research, but also indicate that a more complete and accurate understanding of histrionism would include extraversion. The implications of the findings for DSM-5 and future research are discussed. Copyright 2010 John Wiley {\{}{\&}{\}} Sons, Ltd.},

Through the use of electronic- and bibliography-based searches, the authors identified studies examining the course of cognitive functioning in first episode patients. The results of this review indicated that first episode patients at presentation for treatment often show compromised cognitive functioning, particularly in the domains of verbal learning and memory, psychomotor speed and attention. However, in comparison with patients with a longer illness history, first episode patients demonstrate significantly superior performance. In longitudinal studies of first episode patients, cognitive functioning generally remained static, suggesting limited change in performance over the first several years of the illness.

Identifying which neurons and circuits control which behaviors has been a laborious piecemeal process, usually for one observer-defined behavior at a time. We present a fundamentally different approach to neuron-behavior mapping. We optogenetically activated 1054 identified neuron lines in Drosophila larvae and tracked the behavioral responses from 37,780 animals. Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

Instead of advocating PRS, Johannessen {\{}{\&}{\}} McGorry (Johannessen 2010), have offered an alternative: a ‘Pluripotent risk syndrome'. This less specific prodrome reflects the unpredictable nature of “Ultra-High Risk” states which have been shown to be more likely to develop into a non-psychotic mood disorder than schizophrenia (Hoon 2012). The corollary this is thus; could patients who exhibit significant depressive features (regardless of diagnosis) be initially identified as having a 'Pluripotent risk syndrome‘? Ten adult patients (6 males {\{}{\&}{\}} 4 females, aged 19-26 years old) with four broad psychiatric diagnoses (Depression, Schizoaffective disorder, Borderline personality disorder and psychotic illness) were chosen from an anonimised database of the patients and their symptomatology as assessed by CAARMS was retrospectively assessed to see if the presence of depressive symptoms supported the case for a “Pluripotent risk syndrome”. Though patients diagnosed with depression frequently exhibited depressive symptoms, psychotic symptoms were also apparent, albeit in comparatively decreased severity. Patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder had depressive symptoms more frequently than psychotic symptoms, but these were comparatively less severe. Borderline personality disorder patients exhibited depressive symptoms more frequently than psychotic symptoms. Psychotic illnesses frequently had depressive symptoms, but more typically (and unsurprisingly) had comparatively more severe psychotic than depressive symptoms.Hence we propose that the concept of a “Pluripotent risk syndrome” is in our view born out},

The proposed DSM-5 criteria seem to only insufficiently resolve the problems inherent to the current classification of AN because (1) the A criterion does not include a reference to allow the clinician to decide if the (young) patient meets the weight criterion, (2) the AN patient first must have evolved the cognitive capacity for complex abstract reasoning in order to fulfill the criteria B and C (Bravender et al. in Eur Eat Disord Rev 18:79-89, 2010), (3) physical symptoms of starvation including the neuroendocrine dysfunction characteristic of AN are not a diagnostic requirement, and (4) the subtypes are not helpful for classification of younger patients who almost all have the restricting type. On these grounds the proposed DSM-5 criteria will perpetuate the diagnostic tradition of a high percentage of patients who are subsumed under the diagnosis of eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), thus hampering both clinical practice and research. The use of our recently proposed alternative criteria for AN would result in most children and adolescents with an AN-like phenotype receiving a diagnosis of AN. Accordingly, our proposed criteria would be readily applicable to children, adolescents and adults.},

Twelve healthy and right handed subjects were instructed to perform a task under real and imagery conditions. The task was performed simultaneously to electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. When compared the conditions, we found a statistically significant difference in favor of real condition revealed by performing an unpaired t-test with multiple corrections of Bonferroni, demonstrating negative activity on electrode C3 and positive activity on the electrode C4 only in motor response phase. These findings revealed similar functional connections established during real and imagery conditions, suggesting that there are common neural substrate and similar properties of functional integration shared by conditions.},

The main diagnoses were depression and anxiety disorders (44{\{}{\%}{\}}) causing 4.5{\{}{\%}{\}} of the subjects to be temporarily suspended from their graduate studies; 19.2{\{}{\%}{\}} reported that they had used psychotropic drugs within the previous month, and 47.9{\{}{\%}{\}} referred to sleep disturbances. Suicidal tendencies were mentioned by 18{\{}{\%}{\}} of those interviewed. Students with emotional disturbances and academic dysfunctions should be recognized at an early stage, and it is fundamental for them to have access to mental health programs that provide formal, structured and confidential care. Thus, it is important that professors and advisors in graduate programs build a warm and affective learning environment. If we consider the expressive growth in Brazilian scientific production resulting from the implementation of an extensive national system of graduate education, it is important to focus efforts on enhancing and upgrading the mental health care system.},

This paper (I) uses the method of 'philosophical fieldwork' to show that standard approaches use definitions that are both over- and under-inclusive. It argues furthermore that such approaches typically presuppose what is here dubbed an 'estranged' epistemology. This epistemology supposes that our understanding of the world occurs outside of, and consequent on, our experience of it. Instead of this an alternative 'engaged' epistemology is set out. This alternative sees experience itself as the vehicle of our most fundamental comprehending engagement with the world. (II) This, it is argued, makes better sense both of our contact with reality and of the failure of this contact in delusion. (III) The implications of this alternative theorisation for the cognitive psychology of delusion are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Anecdotal reports suggests that most clinicians treat medications as belonging to a class with regard to all therapeutic indications; this means that the whole 'class' of drugs is considered to possesses a specific therapeutic action. The present article explores the possible existence of a true 'class effect' for agents available for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Methods: We reviewed the available treatment data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and explored 16 'agent class'/'treatment issue' cases for bipolar disorder. Four classes of agents were examined: first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), antiepileptics and antidepressants, with respect to their efficacy on four treatment issues of bipolar disorder (BD) (acute mania, acute bipolar depression, maintenance against mania, maintenance against depression). Results: From the 16 'agent class'/' treatment issue' cases, only 3 possible class effects were detected, and they all concerned acute mania and antipsychotics. Four effect cases have not been adequately studied (FGAs against acute bipolar depression and in maintenance protection from depression, and antidepressants against acute mania and protection from mania) and they all concern treatment cases with a high risk of switching to the opposite pole, thus research in these areas is poor. There is no 'class effect' at all concerning antiepileptics. Conclusions: The available data suggest that a 'class effect' is the exception rather than the rule in the treatment of BD. However, the possible presence of a 'class effect' concept discourages clinicians from continued scientific training and reading. Focused educational intervention might be necessary to change this attitude.},

Unfortunately, one age cohort, children under 13 years of age, have been excluded from this critical alteration in clinical intervention strategy, and its associated improved clinical outcome. One of the barriers to inclusion of younger children is the lack of knowledge about diagnostic issues related to attenuated psychotic symptoms in this age sample. This report focuses on our experience with evaluating attenuated psychotic symptoms in young children, in particular subthreshold hallucinations and delusions, using semistructured interviews. The inclusion of both Caregiver and Child report sections and the addition of concrete, detailed examples of clear-conscience, non-stress-related subthreshold psychotic symptoms are likely to be necessary.},

However, whether a smaller volume in itself reflects a neuroanatomical correlate for increased susceptibility to develop mood disorders remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between cerebellar volume and neurotic personality traits in a non-clinical subject sample. 3T Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired, and trait depression and anxiety scales of the revised NEO personality inventory were assessed in thirty-eight healthy right-handed volunteers. Results showed that cerebellar volume corrected for total brain volume was inversely associated with depressive and anxiety-related personality traits. Cerebellar gray and white matter contributed equally to the observed associations. Our findings extend earlier clinical observations by showing that cerebellar volume covaries with neurotic personality traits in healthy volunteers. The results may point towards a possible role of the cerebellum in the vulnerability to experience negative affect. In conclusion, cerebellar volumes may constitute a clinico-neuroanatomical correlate for the development of depression- and anxiety-related symptoms.},

abstract = {Working memory, attention and executive control functions are central areas of neuropsychological research in schizophrenia. These concepts implicitly refer to the basic temporal structure of mental life as an integration of past, present and future. From a phenomenological point of view, they may be paralleled to the structure of internal time consciousness as analyzed by Husserl, consisting of a retentional, presentational and protentional function. These synthetic functions, operating at the most basic layer of consciousness, are capable of integrating the sequence of single moments into an 'intentional arc', enabling us to direct ourselves towards objects and goals in a meaningful way. On this background, basic symptoms of schizophrenia such as formal thought disorder, loss of automatic performances and disturbances of self-awareness may be conceived as caused by a weakening and dissolution of the intentional arc. A failure of the continuous intertwining of succeeding moments, and especially of the protentional function, leads to a loss of the tacit or operative intentionality that carries the acts of perceiving, thinking and acting. The loss of tacit, implicit functions undermines the common-sensical understanding of reality and has to be compensated by the deliberate, hyperreflexive reconstruction of everyday performances. Phenomenological analyses may thus establish a link between experimental research on single mental dysfunctions on the one hand and the higher level of the patient's subjective experience on the other.},

abstract = {We compare the reported side effects of medication from the trials of prodromal psychosis treatment. We note that the side effects of antipsychotics are those described in the usual pharmacology of these substances and that the severity of side effects are dependent on dosage, with more side effects at higher doses. We report on the search for alternative compounds for the treatment of prodromal psychosis. Omega fatty acids and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy are certainly good adjuvant treatments for suspected prodromal psychosis. With further evidence they may be considered appropriate to use as monotherapy, particularly in the early prodrome. Treatment of prodromal psychosis continues to present a number of risks; therefore the decision to treat ultimately must depend on the symptoms presented by the individual.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the “Bayesian revolution” that is sweeping across multiple disciplines but has yet to gain a foothold in organizational research. The foundations of Bayesian estimation and inference are first reviewed. Then, two empirical examples are provided to show how Bayesian methods can overcome limitations of frequentist methods: (a) a structural equation model of testosterone's effect on status in teams, where a Bayesian approach allows directly testing a traditional null hypothesis as a research hypothesis and allows estimating all possible residual covariances in a measurement model, neither of which are possible with frequentist methods; and (b) an ANOVA-style model from a true experiment of ego depletion's effects on performance, where Bayesian estimation with informative priors allows results from all previous research (via a meta-analysis and other previous studies) to be combined with estimates of study effects in a principled manner, yielding support for hypotheses that is not obtained with frequentist methods. Data are available from the first author, code for the program Mplus is provided, and tables illustrate how to present Bayesian results. In conclusion, the many benefits and few hindrances of Bayesian methods are discussed, where the major hindrance has been an easily solvable lack of familiarity by organizational researchers. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing attention has been given to the transparency of potential conflicts of interest in clinical medicine and biomedical sciences, particularly in journal publishing and science advisory panels. The authors examined the degree and type of financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry of panel members responsible for revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM). METHODS: By using multimodal screening techniques the authors investigated the financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry of 170 panel members who contributed to the diagnostic criteria produced for the DSM-IV and the DSM-IV-TR. RESULTS: Of the 170 DSM panel members 95 (56{\{}{\%}{\}}) had one or more financial associations with companies in the pharmaceutical industry. One hundred percent of the members of the panels on 'Mood Disorders' and 'Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders' had financial ties to drug companies. The leading categories of financial interest held by panel members were research funding (42{\{}{\%}{\}}), consultancies (22{\{}{\%}{\}}) and speakers bureau (16{\{}{\%}{\}}). CONCLUSIONS: Our inquiry into the relationships between DSM panel members and the pharmaceutical industry demonstrates that there are strong financial ties between the industry and those who are responsible for developing and modifying the diagnostic criteria for mental illness. The connections are especially strong in those diagnostic areas where drugs are the first line of treatment for mental disorders. Full disclosure by DSM panel members of their financial relationships with for-profit entities that manufacture drugs used in the treatment of mental illness is recommended.},

One-hundred participants representing five distinct multi-agency groups: psychiatrists, community psychiatric nurses, approved social workers, patients and informal carers operating within Leicestershire, England were interviewed using a standard case vignette describing a person whose behaviour suggests he may have schizophrenia. The results showed that each of the study's multi-agency groups implicitly supports a complex range of model dimensions regarding the nature of schizophrenia, the appropriateness of specific forms of treatment and care, and their respective rights and obligations towards each other. The influence of these implicit model patterns on processes of shared decision making are discussed through evaluating their contribution to our understanding of the power relationships existing between various practitioner groups (including informal carers), and between practitioners and patients during clinical encounters. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The scientific exploration of prepsychotic detection and intervention in psychosis has just commenced. To identify developing psychosis at prodromal stages, it is important to learn how patients and families perceive initial prodromes naturalistically. We must understand better what we are going to detect, because the essential components of this phase, particularly the subjective experiences, remain unsettled. In a series of 19 first episode DSM-IV schizophrenia patients, we explore prodromal phenomena in depth and identify potential core dimensions. On the basis of our findings, we describe experiences and behaviors that appear to be essential components of initial prodromes. The subjects reported serious difficulties interpreting and talking about prodromal experiences at the time these occurred, causing delayed identification. We report detailed reasons for this, pointing out vulnerable aspects of at-risk assessments. From eight proposed groups of experiences, two are highlighted as tentative core dimensions: "disturbance of perception of self" and "extreme preoccupation by and withdrawal to overvalued ideas." Four potential dimensions of prodromal behavior are also identified: (1) quit school, university, or job, or major school truancy, (2) marked and lasting observable shift of interests, (3) marked and lasting social passivity, withdrawal, or isolation, and (4) marked and lasting change in global appearance or behavior. We argue that the findings, the phenomena, and their significance in prodromes are valid because they are logical and coherent in light of clinical experience as well as the empirical literature of a full century.},

DSM not only influences how medical and mental health care professionals diagnose and treat patients but also impacts health insurance policies, research funding, and clinical trials. Revisions to diagnostic criteria must be carefully considered, empirically based, and consistent with current thinking both within the field and across relevant fields. Resultant criteria should be descriptive and non-judgmental and based on empirical findings without recourse to assumed etiologies.

abstract = {Abstract We describe a comprehensive linear approach to the problem of imaging brain activity with high temporal as well as spatial resolution based on combining EEG and MEG data with anatomical constraints derived from MRI images. The "inverse problem" of estimating the distribution of dipole strengths over the cortical surface is highly underdetermined, even given closely spaced EEG and MEG recordings. We have obtained much better solutions to this problem by explicitly incorporating both local cortical orientation as well as spatial covariance of sources and sensors into our formulation. An explicit polygonal model of the cortical manifold is first constructed as follows: (1) slice data in three orthogonal planes of section (needle-shaped voxels) are combined with a linear deblurring technique to make a single high-resolution 3-D image (cubic voxels), (2) the image is recursively flood-filled to determine the topology of the gray-white matter border, and (3) the resulting continuous surface is refined by relaxing it against the original 3-D gray-scale image using a deformable template method, which is also used to computationally flatten the cortex for easier viewing. The explicit solution to an error minimization formulation of an optimal inverse linear operator (for a particular cortical manifold, sensor placement, noise and prior source covariance) gives rise to a compact expression that is practically computable for hundreds of sensors and thousands of sources. The inverse solution can then be weighted for a particular (averaged) event using the sensor covariance for that event. Model studies suggest that we may be able to localize multiple cortical sources with spatial resolution as good as PET with this technique, while retaining a much finer grained picture of activity over time.},

As the field anticipates DSM-5, it is useful to take stock of this history and consider not only how diagnosis impacts our understanding of mental illness but also how contemporary thought influences diagnosis. Before the DSM, the field was disjointed. The publication of the first American diagnostic manual, the precursor of the DSM, mirrored society's interest in organized record keeping and prevention rather than treatment of mental illness. The first and second editions of DSM brought a common language to diagnosis and were largely the work of outpatient and academic psychiatrists rather than those based in large state hospitals. The third edition of the DSM saw the shift in American psychiatry's leadership from the eminent clinician to the researcher, whereas the fourth edition reflected the rise of "evidence-based medicine.'' DSM-5 will likewise represent the current status of the field-not only with regard to science but also reflecting the place of American psychiatry in medicine today.},

abstract = {Thomas Fuchs, a leading figure in contemporary phenomenological psychopathology, focuses his research on what he terms the corporealization of the body in cases of psychiatric disorder. In this paper I critique this central notion of corporealization on three fronts. First, I show that Fuchs conflates at least three fundamentally different conceptions of corporealization. Second, I argue that Fuchs does not commit himself to a truly phenomenological ontology, instead founding his work on an unjustifiable combination of naturalistic and phenomenological ontological presuppositions. Third, I argue that Fuchs reaches many of his conclusions by way of illegitimate “phenomenological reasoning.” The kind of evidence he uses and the way he reasons from this evidence conflicts with classical phenomenology. I conclude by suggesting more legitimate avenues of research for the field of phenomenological psychopathology, with the hope that these considerations will assist in the project of better understanding and distinguishing amongst psychiatric disorders.},

@article{Sanislow2010,
abstract = {There exists a divide between findings from integrative neuroscience and clinical research focused on mechanisms of psychopathology. Specifically, a clear correspondence does not emerge between clusters of complex clinical symptoms and dysregulated neurobiological systems, with many apparent redundancies. For instance, many mental disorders involve multiple disruptions in putative mechanistic factors (e.g., excessive fear, deficient impulse control), and different disrupted mechanisms appear to play major roles in many disorders. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework is a heuristic to facilitate the incorporation of behavioral neuroscience in the study of psychopathology. Such integration might be achieved by shifting the central research focus of the field away from clinical description to more squarely examine aberrant mechanisms. RDoC first aims to identify reliable and valid psychological and biological mechanisms and their disruptions, with an eventual goal of understanding how anomalies in these mechanisms drive psychiatric symptoms. This approach will require new methods to ascertain samples, relying on hypothesized psychopathological mechanisms to define experimental groups instead of traditional diagnostic categories. RDoC, by design, uncouples research efforts from clinically familiar categories to focus directly on fundamental mechanisms of psychopathology. RDoC proposes a matrix of domains and levels of analyses and invites the field to test and refine the framework. If RDoC is successful, the domains will ultimately relate to familiar psychopathologies in ways that promote new knowledge regarding etiology and more efficient development of new preventive and treatment interventions.},

abstract = {The term "nosological classification" is often used in connection with medical classification systems, and the tendency is to equate it with "diagnosis" and "validity." However, particularly in the case of psychiatry this is far from always being the case. From a scientific point of view, the two most up-to-date classification systems in use today - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) - may be considered as the theoretical basis of current psychiatric nosology. In this paper we show that the instrumentally generated DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnoses of schizophrenia have relatively low validity in comparison with clinician expert diagnoses. If medical classification is to be realistic, simple to use, and reliable, nosological systems must be based not only on established facts, but also on theoretical assumptions regarding the nature of disease.},

abstract = {Identification of youth at risk for or with early psychosis has become the focus of many research and clinical initiatives, as early intervention may be linked to better long-term outcomes. Efforts to facilitate identification have led to the development of several self-report instruments that intend to quickly assess "attenuated" psychosis, potentially screening people for further evaluation. The widely used Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) includes the atypicality scale, a scale that may be useful for risk screening as it is designed to recognize emerging symptoms of psychosis. The current study aimed to evaluate the utility of the BASC-2 for identifying youth at high clinical risk or with early psychosis within a sample of 70 help-seeking participants aged 12-22. Atypicality scores were compared to risk status (low-risk, high-risk or early psychosis) as determined by the clinician-administered Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS). The relative accuracy of the atypicality scale was evaluated against three self-report screeners specifically designed to identify this population. Results indicate that the BASC-2 atypicality scale may be a useful tool for identifying youth in early stages of psychosis. Moreover, the atypicality scale is comparable if not superior to other specialized risk screening instruments in terms of predictive ability. Given the widespread use of the BASC-2 across educational and mental health settings, evidence for convergent validity between the BASC-2 atypicality scale and SIPS diagnoses has the potential to make screening available to a greater population and facilitate earlier detection and intervention.},

abstract = {The renewal of the philosophical debate in psychiatry is one exciting news of recent years. However, its use in psychopharmacology may be problematic, ranging from self-confinement into the realm of values (which leaves the evidence-based domain unchallenged) to complete rejection of scientific evidence. In this paper philosophy is conceived as a conceptual audit of clinical psychopharmacology. Its function is to criticise the epistemological and methodological problems of current neopositivist, ingenuously realist and evidence-servant psychiatry from within the scientific stance and with the aim of aiding psychopharmacologists in practicing a more self-aware, critical and possibly useful clinical practice. Three examples are discussed to suggest that psychopharmacological practice needs conceptual clarification. At the diagnostic level it is shown that the crisis of the current diagnostic system and the problem of comorbidity strongly influence psychopharmacological results, new conceptualizations more respondent to the psychopharmacological requirements being needed. Heterogeneity of research samples, lack of specificity of psychotropic drugs, difficult generalizability of results, need of a phenomenological study of drug-induced psychopathological changes are discussed herein. At the methodological level the merits and limits of evidence-based practice are considered, arguing that clinicians should know the best available evidence but that guidelines should not be constrictive (due to several methodological biases and rhetorical tricks of which the clinician should be aware, sometimes respondent to extra-scientific, economical requests). At the epistemological level it is shown that the clinical stance is shaped by implicit philosophical beliefs about the mind/body problem (reductionism, dualism, interactionism, pragmatism), and that philosophy can aid physicians to be more aware of their beliefs in order to choose the most useful view and to practice coherently. In conclusion, psychopharmacologists already use methodological audit (e.g. statistical audit); similarly, conceptual clarification is needed in both research planning/evaluation and everyday psychopharmacological practice.},

abstract = {The reliability of the diagnosis of bipolar-II disorder (BP-II) is still a problem. Semi-structured interviews by clinicians might partly overcome this problem. The aims of this study were to find the degree of agreement in the diagnosis of BP-II between the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and a semi-structured interview based on Angst's hypomania checklist (Angst et al., 2003), and to assess the priority among hypomanic symptoms for the diagnosis of BP-II. Remitted depression outpatients (N = 102) were interviewed during a follow-up visit using th Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), and then with Angst's semi-structured interview, following DSMIV criteria. Bipolar I (BP-I) patients were excluded. Using the SCID, 29 patients were diagnosed BP-II, 26 BP-I, and 47 major depressive disorder (MDD). By the semi-structured interview 69 patients were diagnosed BP-II, 33 MDD, and none BP-I. Agreement for the diagnosis of BP-II between the two interviews was 53.9{\{}{\%}{\}} (k = 0.18). Re-analysis, after deleting the SCID question on the impact on functioning (DSM-IV unclear boundary between BP-I and BP-II), increased agreement to 78.4{\{}{\%}{\}} (k = 0.55). Elevated mood and overactivity (increased goal-directed activity) had th lowest agreement (k = 0.46 0.49). For predicting BP-II, overactivity had the highest sensitivity (94.2{\{}{\%}{\}}), whil elevated mood had a sensitivity of 84.0{\{}{\%}{\}}. Multivariate analysis for predicting BP-II (diagnosed by semi-structured interview), including all DSM-IV hypomanic symptoms, found that mood change and overactivity were the only independent predictors. Overactivity plus at least three symptoms (as suggested by Angst and Gamma, 2002) were present in 71 patients, of whom 91.5{\{}{\%}{\}} also met DSM-IV criteria for hypomania. Overactivity and elevated mood were strongly associated (but not overactivity and irritability). Findings may support a diagnosis of BP-II based on Angst's semi-structured interview versus the fully structured SCID interview. While DSM-IV always requires mood change for the diagnosis of hypomania, the present findings may suggest that overactivity could have the same priority, as suggested by Angst et al. (2003) and by Akiskal et al. (1977, 2001, 2003).},

Rather than simply giving us a new subject matter-the ethical issues arising from neuroscience-to attend to, neuroethics offers us the opportunity to refine the tools we use. Ethicists often need to appeal to the intuitions provoked by consideration of cases to evaluate the permissibility of types of actions; data from the sciences of the mind give us reason to believe that some of these intuitions are less reliable than others. I focus on the doctrine of double effect to illustrate my case, arguing that experimental results suggest that appeal to it might be question-begging. The doctrine of double effect is supposed to show that there is a moral difference between effects that are brought about intentionally and those that are merely foreseen; I argue that the data suggest that we regard some effects as merely foreseen only because we regard bringing them about as permissible. Appeal to the doctrine of double effect therefore cannot establish that there are such moral differences.},

The number of such studies has risen dramatically in the last decade, and an understanding of how typical functional MRI (fMRI) experiments are analysed will help the clinician critically reading the literature. Functional imaging studies are typically undertaken to compare brain responses either from a single population in two different conditions (for example, healthy volunteers in the presence vs. the absence of a flickering visual stimulus), or from two populations (for example, neurological patients performing a task vs. control subjects performing the same task).

abstract = {The neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, which posits that the illness is the end state of abnormal neurodevelopmental processes that started years before the illness onset, is widely accepted, and has long been dominant for childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders. This selective review updates our 2005 review of recent studies that have impacted, or have the greatest potential to modify or extend, the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Longitudinal whole-population studies support a dimensional, rather than categorical, concept of psychosis. New studies suggest that placental pathology could be a key measure in future prenatal high-risk studies. Both common and rare genetic variants have proved surprisingly diagnostically nonspecific, and copy number variants (CNVs) associated with schizophrenia are often also associated with autism, epilepsy and intellectual deficiency. Large post-mortem gene expression studies and prospective developmental multi-modal brain imaging studies are providing critical data for future clinical and high-risk developmental brain studies. Whether there can be greater molecular specificity for phenotypic characterization is a subject of current intense study and debate, as is the possibility of neuronal phenotyping using human pluripotent-inducible stem cells. Biological nonspecificity, such as in timing or nature of early brain development, carries the possibility of new targets for broad preventive treatments.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 10 April 2012; doi:10.1038/mp.2012.23.},

Reviewing studies from functional (i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) and structural (i.e., magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, voxel-based morphometry) neuroimaging paradigms, we report a striking consensus suggesting that variations in a distributed network predict individual differences found on intelligence and reasoning tasks. We describe this network as the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT). The P-FIT model includes, by Brodmann areas (BAs): the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BAs 6, 9, 10, 45, 46, 47), the inferior (BAs 39, 40) and superior (BA 7) parietal lobule, the anterior cingulate (BA 32), and regions within the temporal (BAs 21, 37) and occipital (BAs 18, 19) lobes. White matter regions (i.e., arcuate fasciculus) are also implicated. The P-FIT is examined in light of findings from human lesion studies, including missile wounds, frontal lobotomy/leukotomy, temporal lobectomy, and lesions resulting in damage to the language network (e.g., aphasia), as well as findings from imaging research identifying brain regions under significant genetic control. Overall, we conclude that modern neuroimaging techniques are beginning to articulate a biology of intelligence. We propose that the P-FIT provides a parsimonious account for many of the empirical observations, to date, which relate individual differences in intelligence test scores to variations in brain structure and function. Moreover, the model provides a framework for testing new hypotheses in future experimental designs.},

abstract = {Patients with behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) present with insidious changes in personality and interpersonal conduct that indicate progressive disintegration of the neural circuits involved in social cognition, emotion regulation, motivation, and decision making. The underlying pathological changes are heterogeneous and are characterised by various intraneuronal inclusions. Biomarkers to detect these histopathological changes in life are becoming increasingly important with the development of disease-modifying drugs. Gene mutations have been found that collectively account for around 10-20{\%} of cases. Recently, criteria proposed for bvFTD define three levels of diagnostic certainty: possible, probable, and definite. Detailed history taking from family members to elicit behavioural features underpins the diagnostic process, with support from neuropsychological testing designed to detect impairment in decision making, emotion processing, and social cognition. Brain imaging is important for increasing the level of diagnostic certainty. A recently developed staging instrument shows much promise for monitoring patients and evaluating therapies, which at present are aimed at symptom amelioration. Carer education and support remain of paramount importance.},

This paper reviews the extended, multi-faceted research planning preparations that APA has undertaken, several in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, to assess the current state of diagnosis-relevant research and to generate short- and long-term recommendations for research needed to enrich DSM-V and future psychiatric classifi cations. This research review and planning process has underscored widespread interest among nosologists in the US and globally regarding the potential benefi ts for research and clinical practice of incorporating a dimensional component into the existing categorical, or binary, classifi cation system in the DSM. Toward this end, the APA and its partners convened an international conference in July 2006 to critically appraise the use of dimensional constructs in psychiatric diagnostic systems. Resultant papers appear in this issue of International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research and in a forthcoming monograph to be published by APA.

Similarly, working memory deficits have long been thought to be among the core cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, making it a ripe area for translation. This article provides a brief overview of the current theories and data on the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in working memory, which is a summary of the presentation and discussion on working memory that occurred at the first Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) meeting (Washington, D.C.). At this meeting, the consensus was that the constructs of goal maintenance and interference control were the most ready to be pursued as part of a translational cognitive neuroscience effort at future CNTRICS meetings. The constructs of long-term memory reactivation, capacity, and strategic encoding were felt to be of great clinical interest but requiring more basic research. In addition, the group felt that the constructs of maintenance over time and updating in working memory had growing construct validity at the psychological and neural levels but required more research in schizophrenia before these should be considered as targets for a clinical trials setting. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials in acute bipolar mania to summarize available data on drug treatment of mania. Methods: We included trials of medications licensed in the USA or UK for the treatment of any phase of bipolar disorder. Outcomes investigated were changes in mania scores, attrition, extrapyramidal effects and weight change. Data were combined through meta-analyses. Results: We included 13 studies (involving 3,089 subjects) and identified 2 studies for each of the following medications: carbamazepine, haloperidol, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, valproate semisodium and aripiprazole. All drugs showed significant benefit compared with placebo for reduction in mania scores. Compared with placebo, for all antipsychotics pooled, response to treatment (50{\{}{\%}{\}} reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale scores) was increased more than 1.7 times relative risk (RR) = 1.74, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval (CI) = 1.54, 1.96; for all mood stabilizers pooled, response to treatment was doubled (RR 2.01, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI = 1.66, 2.43). Overall withdrawals were 34{\{}{\%}{\}} fewer (2443{\{}{\%}{\}}) with antipsychotics, and 26{\{}{\%}{\}} fewer (1039{\{}{\%}{\}}) with mood stabilizers. However, for carbamazepine, aripiprazole and lithium an increase in risk of withdrawal could not be excluded. Small but significant increases in extrapyramidal side effects occurred with risperidone and Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of acute mania. Their effect sizes are similar. Small differences between effect sizes may be due to differences in the patients included in the studies or to chance. Carbamazepine and lithium may be more poorly tolerated, and antipsychotics cause more extrapyramidal side effects.},

abstract = {The DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders (PDs) Work Group has recommended a reformulation of the PD section. In the present review I examined the empirical support for the Work Group's criticisms of the DSM-IV approach that were central to the justification for radically changing the diagnostic criteria. The Work Group indicated that comorbidity among the DSM-IV PDs is excessive, and to reduce comorbidity they recommended deleting five PDs. The studies they cited demonstrating high levels of comorbidity were of samples of psychiatric patients. A review of the epidemiological literature shows that comorbidity rates are much lower than in patient samples, and this challenges the proposition that high comorbidity is due to the diagnostic criteria. Moreover, the empirical support for the exclusion of some disorders over others is lacking. The Work Group noted that the diagnostic stability of the PDs is modest. However, modest levels of diagnostic stability may be largely attributable to methodological factors such test-retest unreliability, state effects, regression to the mean, and measurement error due to repeated assessments, rather than a reflection of inadequacies of the diagnostic system. Thus, modest stability is likely to be found in any approach toward diagnosing PDs. The present review therefore suggests that several of the core problems linked to the DSM-IV approach toward diagnosing PDs are more likely due to methodological factors than inadequacies of the criteria themselves. The Work Group's recommendation to delete five PDs is inconsistent with the explicit guidelines established for making revisions for DSM-5 which specify that for a disorder to be deleted there should be a thorough review of that disorder's clinical utility and validity.

abstract = {The earliest stages of delusion are characterized by an overabundance of meaningful coincidences impinging on the sufferer's existing worldview. Successive events are seen by him as pointing to, and then confirming, a fundamentally new reality that takes him over and engulfs his everyday life. Research over the last 4 decades has revealed the importance of dopamine (DA), D2 receptors, and the basal ganglia in psychotic thinking. Recent work has implicated the aberrant reward learning initiated by the excess release of striatal DA in the attribution of excessive importance or "salience" to insignificant stimuli and events. But our knowledge of what is happening beyond D2 receptors has remained scant. The gap is especially apparent at the cellular and microcircuit levels, encompassing the plastic changes, which are believed to be essential for new learning, and whose processes may go awry in major mental illness. Now new pharmacological findings are advancing our understanding of information processing and learning within the striatum. DA has an important role in setting the strength of individual striatal connections, but it does not act in isolation. Two other modulator systems are critical, the endocannabinoids and adenosine. Thus, at medium spiny neurons belonging to the indirect pathway, D2 stimulation evokes endocannabinoid-mediated depression of cortical inputs. Adenosine acting at A2A receptors elicits the opposite effect. Remarkably, drugs that target the endocannabinoid and purinergic systems also have pro- or antipsychotic properties. Here, we discuss how the 3 modulators regulate learning within the striatum and how their dysfunction may lead to delusional thinking.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the gray matter segments from T1 structural MR images of the brain in first-episode schizophrenic subjects (n = 34) and normal control subjects (n = 36) using automated voxel-based morphometry (VBM). This study is novel in that few studies have examined subjects in their first episode of schizophrenia. The subjects were recruited for the Edinburgh High Risk project and regional brain volumes were previously measured using a semi-automated volumetric region of interest (ROI) method of analysis. The primary interest was to compare the results from the compatible parts of the ROI study and the primary VBM approach. Our secondary interest was to compare the results of a study-specific template that was constructed from the control group to those using the generic T1 template (152 Montreal Neurological Institute brains) supplied with SPM99 (statistical parametric mapping). The images were processed and statistically analyzed using the SPM99 program. VBM analysis identified significant decreases in gray matter in the schizophrenics relative to the normal control group at the corrected voxel level (P {\textless} 0.05) in the right anterior cingulate, right medial frontal lobe, left middle temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, and the left limbic lobe. There were no increases in gray matter in the schizophrenics relative to the control group. The construction of a customized template appeared to improve the detection of structural abnormalities. The analyses were subsequently restricted to voxels within the amygdala-hip-pocampal complex using the SPM small-volume correction. This identified gray matter decreases in the schizophrenics, at the corrected voxel level (P {\textless} 0.05), in the left and right uncus and parahippocampal gyri and the right amygdala. These results are compatible with and extend the relevant findings of the previous volumetric ROI analysis, when allowing for the differences between the methods and interpretation of their results. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

In this study, we tested the novel hypothesis that men and women differ in the neural correlates of affective experience, rather than in the intensity of neural activity, with women being more internally (interoceptively) focused and men being more externally (visually) focused. Adult men (n = 17) and women (n = 17) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study while viewing affectively potent images and rating their moment-to-moment feelings of subjective arousal. We found that men and women do not differ overall in their intensity of moment-to-moment affective experiences when viewing evocative images, but instead, as predicted, women showed a greater association between the momentary arousal ratings and neural responses in the anterior insula cortex, which represents bodily sensations, whereas men showed stronger correlations between their momentary arousal ratings and neural responses in the visual cortex. Men also showed enhanced functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior insula cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which constitutes the circuitry involved with regulating shifts of attention to the world. These results demonstrate that the same affective experience is realized differently in different people, such that women's feelings are relatively more self-focused, whereas men's feelings are relatively more world-focused.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that genetic factors are significant in predisposing individuals to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Family studies have demonstrated significantly higher rates of OCD in parents and siblings of OCD probands with an age-corrected morbid risk ranging from approximately 10{\%} to 35{\%} in first-degree relatives. Twin studies suggest that this familiality is, in part, due to genetic factors, and results from complex segregation analyses imply the existence of genes that have major effects on the transmission of OCD. However, not all cases of OCD seem to be familial. Furthermore, it appears that even in the familial form, there are clinical and genetic heterogeneities. Thus, future studies should either adjust the prevalence rates used in genetic analyses to account for nonfamilial cases or perform separate analyses of those families with a demonstrably familial form of OCD. Furthermore, in complex psychiatric disorders such as OCD, a single genetic locus may influence only a small part of phenotypic variance, and other genetic and environmental factors may interact in determining clinical phenotype. The implications of this finding on clinical and genetic heterogeneity in OCD are discussed.},

abstract = {Many recent models of schizophrenia have attempted to explain the so-called first-rank symptoms in terms of a breakdown in the self-monitoring of thoughts and behaviours. These models have focused on the most common symptom of schizophrenia auditory hallucinations - suggesting that they may represent disordered self-monitoring of internal speech. As such, much attention has been given to the role of the temporal and frontal cortices in the clinical presentation of patients with schizophrenia. In this review, we examine the role of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in schizophrenia within the context of recent models of self-monitoring deficits in these patients. Attentional dysfunctions and certain impairments of motor control and motor imagery all point towards the involvement of the parietal cortex in the disorder. In particular, we suggest that patients experiencing passivity phenomena (e.g., delusions of control) may have particular impairments of parietal function related to poor utilisation of forward models of intended actions. We also present a novel hypothesis that suggests differential impairments of the left and right parietal cortices in schizophrenia may help explain many of the first-rank symptoms of the disorder. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a debilitating neurological disorder with a world-wide prevalence of 1{\%}; there is a strong genetic component, with an estimated heritability of 80-85{\%}. Although post-mortem studies have revealed reduced brain volume, cell size, spine density and abnormal neural distribution in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of SCZD brain tissue and neuropharmacological studies have implicated dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic activity in SCZD, the cell types affected in SCZD and the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease state remain unclear. To elucidate the cellular and molecular defects of SCZD, we directly reprogrammed fibroblasts from SCZD patients into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and subsequently differentiated these disorder-specific hiPSCs into neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1). SCZD hiPSC neurons showed diminished neuronal connectivity in conjunction with decreased neurite number, PSD95-protein levels and glutamate receptor expression. Gene expression profiles of SCZD hiPSC neurons identified altered expression of many components of the cyclic AMP and WNT signalling pathways. Key cellular and molecular elements of the SCZD phenotype were ameliorated following treatment of SCZD hiPSC neurons with the antipsychotic loxapine. To date, hiPSC neuronal pathology has only been demonstrated in diseases characterized by both the loss of function of a single gene product and rapid disease progression in early childhood. We now report hiPSC neuronal phenotypes and gene expression changes associated with SCZD, a complex genetic psychiatric disorder.},

In this ground breaking and controversial work Richard Bentall shatters the myths that surround madness. He shows there is no reassuring dividing line between mental health and mental illness. Severe mental disorders can no longer be reduced to brain chemistry, but must be understood psychologically, as part of normal behaviour andhuman nature. Bentall argues that we need a radically new way of thinking about psychosis and its treatment. Could it be that it is a fear of madness, rather than the madness itself, that is our problem?},

abstract = {It is nearly 10 years since Patrick Haggard and colleagues first reported the 'intentional binding' effect (Haggard, Clark, {\&} Kalogeras, 2002). The intentional binding effect refers to the subjective compression of the temporal interval between a voluntary action and its external sensory consequence. Since the first report, considerable interest has been generated and a fascinating array of studies has accumulated. Much of the interest in intentional binding comes from the promise to shed light on human agency. In this review we survey studies on intentional binding, focusing, in particular, on the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency (the experience of controlling action to influence events in the environment). We suggest that, whilst it is yet to be fully explicated, the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency is compelling. We conclude by considering outstanding questions and future directions for research on intentional binding.},

Members were recruited for workgroups to review the existing DSM-IV, to decide what worked well and which areas needed change, to review the available literature and data, and to propose changes based on an appropriate level of evidence in the literature proportional to the significance of the change. At the halfway point in this process, the Mood Disorders Workgroup has made tentative recommendations to be tested in field trials. These recommendations and some of the basis for them are discussed in this review. Final decisions await the data from field trials, possible revisions by the workgroups, and action by the task force.

abstract = {Three different analysis platforms using LC-MS were successfully developed for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of an antibody drug in serum. These analysis platforms can be selectively used for different types of protein drugs, which ranged from a very specific for a particular drug (antibody enrichment) to a less specific for any antibody drugs with an Fc domain (protein A enrichment), and to a very generic method that can be used for any protein drugs (albumin depletion method). In this manner, the three platforms will be applicable to a wide range of antibody therapeutic studies for different species. The analysis using an albumin depletion method (with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)) achieved the detection of the drug (to 1 ng) in an aliquot of serum (30 microL) with a 5-order magnitude of linearity. The analysis using protein A enrichment (with SDS-PAGE) achieved the detection of the drug at a 50-fold lower level (to 0.02 ng). Without the use of SDS-PAGE for separation, the use of protein A enrichment achieved the detection to 10 ng and using the antidrug antibody enrichment achieved the detection to 0.1 ng, with a similar linear dynamic range. These three analysis platforms produced good agreement with a mimic PK study of the drug in monkey serum, as compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach. In addition, these analysis platforms can be selectively applied for PK studies of drugs with different requirements of development time and resources. Such as, the antibody enrichment method can be used in a high-throughput manner but limited to a specific protein drug only. On the other hand, the albumin depletion method can be applied to many types of protein drugs but with the laborious sample preparation steps (SDS-PAGE and the subsequent in-gel digestion). When antidrug antibodies are not available for antibody drugs or the sensitivity requirement is not stringent (e.g., {\textgreater}10 ng), using protein A enrichment (without using SDS-PAGE) seems to be a good choice for PK studies which require fast throughput.},

abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia patients are typically found to have low IQ both pre- and post-onset, in comparison to the general population. However, a subgroup of patients displays above average IQ pre-onset. The nature of these patients' illness and its relationship to typical schizophrenia is not well understood. The current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia patients. Methods: We identified 29schizophrenia patients of exceptionally high pre-morbid intelligence (mean estimated pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) of 120), of whom around half also showed minimal decline (less than 10 IQ points) from their estimated pre-morbid IQ. We compared their symptom scores (SAPS, SANS, OPCRIT, MADRS, GAF, SAI-E) with a comparison group of schizophrenia patients of typical IQ using multinomial logistic regression. Results: The patients with very high pre-morbid IQ had significantly lower scores on negative and disorganised symptoms than typical patients (RRR. =. 0.019; 95{\%} CI. =. 0.001, 0.675, P=. 0.030), and showed better global functioning and insight (RRR. =. 1.082; 95{\%} CI. =. 1.020, 1.148; P=. 0.009). Those with a minimal post-onset IQ decline also showed higher levels of manic symptoms (RRR. =. 8.213; 95{\%} CI. =. 1.042, 64.750, P=. 0.046). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.},

abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) clinical presentation is remarkably diverse, and can vary both within and across patients over time. This variability in the phenotypic expression has led to the hypothesis that OCD is a heterogeneous disorder and that this heterogeneity obscures the findings of clinical, natural history and treatment response studies and complicates the search for vulnerability genes. A complete understanding of what comprises OCD and the underlying etiological mechanisms will require a dramatic change in how the disorder is conceptualized. In this review, several different approaches that may represent the first steps in this reconceptualization are discussed. These approaches include (1) narrowing the phenotype to identify categorically defined more homogeneous and mutually exclusive subtypes of OCD, (2) considering OC symptom dimensions as quantitative components of the more complex OCD phenotype and (3) broadening the phenotype to include other etiologically related conditions. A combined dimensional approach within distinctive subgroups is proposed as probably the most effective in helping to identify the heritable components of OCD. By identifying heritable components of OCD, it should be possible to find genes for these separate components. The review continues with the illustration of the possible role of some epigenetic risk and protective factors in the OCD presentation and the relevance of examining associated traits and/or endophenotypes to enhance our ability to understand the genetic basis of OCD. To conclude, we discuss the variability in treatment outcome and the significance of the development of specific pharmacological and/or behavioral based therapies tailored to each of these phenotypes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive impairment is commonly reported at onset of psychotic disorders. However, the long-term neurocognitive course remains largely uninvestigated in first episode psychosis (FEP) and the relationship to clinically significant subgroups even more so. We report 10 year longitudinal neurocognitive development in a sample of FEP patients, and explore whether the trajectories of cognitive course are related to presence of relapse to psychosis, especially within the first year, with a focus on the course of verbal memory.

METHOD: Forty-three FEP subjects (51{\%} male, 28 ± 9 years) were followed-up neurocognitively over five assessments spanning 10 years. The test battery was divided into four neurocognitive indices; Executive Function, Verbal Learning, Motor Speed, and Verbal Fluency. The sample was grouped into those relapsing or not within the first, second and fifth year.

RESULTS: The four neurocognitive indices showed overall stability over the 10 year period. Significant relapse by index interactions were found for all indices except Executive Function. Follow-up analyses identified a larger significant decrease over time for the encoding measure within Verbal Memory for patients with psychotic relapse in the first year [F (4, 38) = 5.8, p = 0.001, $\eta$(2) = 0.40].

CONCLUSIONS: Main findings are long-term stability in neurocognitive functioning in FEP patients, with the exception of verbal memory in patients with psychotic relapse or non-remission early in the course of illness. We conclude that worsening of specific parts of cognitive function may be expected for patients with on-going psychosis, but that the majority of patients do not show significant change in cognitive performance during the first 10 years after being diagnosed.},

Twin, family, segregation, and linkage studies have demonstrated that OCD is familial, that the familiality is due in part to genetic factors and there are regions of the genome which very likely harbor susceptibility loci for OCD. Over 60 candidate gene studies have been conducted. Most studies have focused on genes in the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. Unfortunately, none have achieved genome-wide significance and with the exception of the glutamate transporter gene, none have been reliably replicated. Future research will requite much larger samples and the collaboration of researchers to be able to identify susceptibility loci for OCD.},

abstract = {Background: Efforts to predict psychosis in individuals at high risk for schizophrenia have focused on the identification of sub-threshold clinical criteria and neurobiological markers, including neuropsychological assessment, structural and functional brain imaging, and psychophysiological testing. We sought to evaluate the relative utility of " psychosis-proneness" measures for prospective prediction of psychotic disorders in a group of young relatives at familial risk for schizophrenia. Methods: We examined the receiver operating characteristics of sub-threshold symptoms in predicting conversion to psychosis in a group of 97 young first- and second- degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia over a 2-year period. Towards this end, we utilized the Structured Interview of Prodromal Symptoms to derive measures of two of the four Scale of Prodromal Symptoms subscales (positive and disorganized) and the Chapman Magical Ideation and Perceptual Aberration scales. These four measures were, together, taken to reflect a putative index of psychosis-proneness. Results: Eleven of the 97 subjects developed a psychotic disorder over 2 years of follow-up. Seventeen of the 97 subjects tested positive on this index of psychosis-proneness at baseline and of these 10 converted to psychosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 91 percent and 92 percent respectively. The positive predictive value of the test was 59 percent and its negative predictive value was 99 percent. Addition of measures of cognitive or social function to the index decreased its predictive ability, reducing its specificity and/or sensitivity. Conclusions: A relatively simple set of clinical measures can be utilized to prospectively identify familial high risk individuals who convert to psychosis with high specificity and sensitivity. Implications for the proposed addition of an " Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome" in DSM-5 are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Sometimes conceptualized as a "risk state" and sometimes as early manifestations of a "disorder," the work has been conducted with several related but different constructs. Early in the preparation of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) public comment was sought on the proposal to create a new disorder termed attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS), and a range of issues emerged that generated interesting and important controversies. In this review, these criticisms are fully discussed, the APS concept is explicated; data relating to reliability, validity, and treatment are updated; the heterogeneity of APS is considered; and alternative views of the construct are presented with an emphasis on developmental pattern with timing for primary and secondary prevention and early treatment. Areas of future research are identified, and a potential roadmap for inclusion in DSM-5.1 is traced.},

METHOD The study sample consisted of 152 people recruited to the West London First-Episode Schizophrenia Study. Self-reported data on drug and alcohol use, as well as information on age at onset of psychosis, were collected. Mental state, cognition (IQ, memory and executive function) and social function were also assessed. RESULTS In total, 60{\%} of the participants were smokers, 27{\%} reported a history of problems with alcohol use, 35{\%} reported current substance use (not including alcohol), and 68{\%} reported lifetime substance use (cannabis and psychostimulants were most commonly used). Cannabis use and gender had independent effects on age at onset of psychosis, after adjusting for alcohol misuse and use of other drugs. CONCLUSIONS The strong association between self-reported cannabis use and earlier onset of psychosis provides further evidence that schizophrenia may be precipitated by cannabis use and/or that the early onset of symptoms is a risk factor for cannabis use.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the methods and reporting of systematic reviews of diagnostic tests. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and five other databases identified reviews of tests used in patients with cancer. Of these, 89 satisfied our inclusion criteria of reporting accuracy of the test compared with a reference test, including an electronic search, and published since 1990. REVIEW METHODS: All reviews were assessed for methods and reporting of objectives, search strategy, participants, clinical setting, index and reference tests, study design, study results, graphs, meta-analysis, quality, bias, and procedures in the review. We assessed 25 randomly selected reviews in more detail. RESULTS: 75{\%} (67) of the reviews stated inclusion criteria, 49{\%} (44) tabulated characteristics of included studies, 40{\%} (36) reported details of study design, 17{\%} (15) reported on the clinical setting, 17{\%} (15) reported on the severity of disease in participants, and 49{\%} (44) reported on whether the tumours were primary, metastatic, or recurrent.

abstract = {The practice of psychiatry has undergone great changes in recent years. In this book, Joel Paris, MD, a veteran psychiatrist, provides a fluently written and accessible "state-of-the-field" assessment. Himself a clinician, researcher, and teacher, Paris focuses on the most striking change within the field - the diverging roles of psychopharmacology and psychotherapy in contemporary practice. Where once psychiatrists were trained in Freudian psychoanalysis - which involved, more than anything else, talking - current pressures in mental health practice, including those imposed by managed care, are leading psychiatrists to treat more and more of their patients exclusively with medication, which is cheaper and faster. At the same time, psychotherapy is increasingly not being taught to new psychiatrists-in-training, even though, as Paris reveals, there is scientific evidence that both talk therapies and medication can play an important role in the treatment of mental illness. These developments are occuring against a backdrop of exploding research in the genetics and neurobiology of mental illness that will continue to drive the field. Paris ends by contemplating how going forward psychiatry can best respond to all these forces and proposes a team-based approach to mental health care. The book will appeal both to specialists and nonspecialists, particularly psychiatric residents and fellows, medical students considering specialization in psychiatry, clinical psychologists, social workers, and general readers, especially consumers of mental health services.},

It has been proposed that suicidal behavior generally requires biological abnormalities concomitant with the personality trait of impulsivity/aggression, besides an acute psychiatric illness or psychosocial stressor. We investigated fronto-limbic anatomical brain abnormalities in suicidal and non-suicidal adult female patients with unipolar depression. Our sample consisted of seven suicidal unipolar patients, 10 non-suicidal unipolar patients and 17 healthy female comparison subjects. The criterion for suicidality was one or more documented lifetime suicide attempts. A 1.5T GE Signa Imaging System running version Signa 5.4.3 software was used to acquire the magnetic resonance imaging images. All anatomical structures were measured blindly, with the subjects' identities and group assignments masked. We used analysis of covariance with age and intracranial volume as covariates and the Tukey-Kramer procedure to compare suicidal patients, non-suicidal patients and healthy comparison subjects. Suicidal patients had smaller right and left orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volumes compared with healthy comparison subjects. Suicidal patients had larger right amygdala volumes than non-suicidal patients. Abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala in suicidal patients may impair decision-making and predispose these patients to act more impulsively and to attempt suicide.},

abstract = {The concept of mood stability is attractive to both patients and clinicians alike, and hence the term 'mood stabilizer' has widespread currency. However, its worldwide acceptance and use in clinical practice is at odds with the absence of official recognition by regulatory authorities. The ideal mood stabilizer is said to have efficacy in the treatment of acute manic and depressive episodes, and also be effective in the prevention of recurrences. However, in reality, few drugs with perhaps the exception of lithium, come close to this gold standard; yet many agents aspire to the title, and some have arguably achieved it prematurely. It is, therefore, important to reconsider the definition of a mood stabilizer and critically review which agents, if any, satisfy the necessary eligibility requirements by reference to reasonable criteria and comparator data. The term mood stabilizer is an important label. It needs to be applied judiciously because it confers clinical credibility and qualifies long-term use in maintenance and prophylaxis. It is also important with respect to developing guidelines for treatment and the further development of novel agents. Most importantly, however, it is a term that is innately appealing because of what it promises: for this reason alone it should encompass only those agents that can deliver.},

It is fully structured to allow administration by non-specialized interviewers. In order to keep it short it focuses on the existence of current disorders. For each disorder, one or two screening questions rule out the diagnosis when answered negatively. Probes for severity, disability or medically explained symptoms are not explored symptom-by-symptom. Two joint papers present the inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the Mini the validity versus the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (this paper) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IH-R patients (SCID) (joint paper). Three-hundred and forty-six patients (296 psychiatric and 50 non-psychiatric) were administered the MINI and the CIDI `gold standard'. Forty two were interviewed by two investigators and 42 interviewed subsequently within two days. Interviewers were trained to use both instruments. The mean duration of the interview was 21 min with the MINI and 92 for corresponding sections of the CIDI. Kappa coefficient, sensitivity and specificity were good or very good for all diagnoses with the exception of generalized anxietydisorder (GAD) (kappa = 0.36), agoraphobia (sensitivity = 0.59) and bulimia (kappa = 0.53). Inter-rater and test-retest reliability were good. The main reasons for discrepancies were identified. The MINI provided reliable DSM-HI-R diagnoses within a short time frame, The study permitted improvements in the formulations for GAD and agoraphobia in the current DSM-IV version of the MINI.},

abstract = {Irritability has recently become a major focus of interest for clinicians and nosologists alike, and its position in the upcoming DSM-5 is currently debated. However, research on irritability has only recently started emerging. Here, I review the recent findings on irritability and its differentially strong relationship to depressive and generalised anxiety disorders compared to disruptive behaviours. Furthermore, I examine the importance of irritability in the recent debate about bipolar disorder in children and adolescents and discuss findings from research into severe mood dysregulation. I next address the relevance of irritability to the two core aims of developmental sensitivity and dimensionality. Finally, I critically discuss the recently proposed putative DSM-5 category of temper dysregulation disorder with dysphoria and make suggestions about future research directions.},

abstract = {It is obvious that emotions are real, but the question is what kind of "real" are they? In this article, I outline a theoretical approach where emotions are a part of social reality. I propose that physical changes (in the face, voice, and body, or neural circuits for behavioral adaptations like freezing, fleeing, or fighting) transform into an emotion when those changes take on psychological functions that they cannot perform by their physical nature alone. This requires socially shared conceptual knowledge that perceivers use to create meaning from these physical changes (as well as the circuitry that supports this meaning making). My claim is that emotions are, at the same time, socially constructed and biologically evident. Only when we understand all the elements that construct emotional episodes, in social, psychological, and biological terms, will we understand the nature of emotion.},

@article{Hutto2016,
abstract = {Philosophy of psychiatry faces a tough choice between two competing ways of understanding mental disorders. The folk psychology (FP) view puts our everyday normative conceptual scheme in the driver's seat – on the assumption that it, and it only, tells us what mental disorders are (1). Opposing this, the scientific image (SI) view (2, 3) holds that our understanding of mental disorders must come, wholly and solely, from the sciences of the mind, unfettered by FP. This paper argues that the FP view is problematic because it is too limited: there is more to the mind than FP allows; hence, we must look beyond FP for properly deep and illuminating explanations of mental disorders. SI promises just this. But when cast in its standard cognitivist formulations, SI is unnecessarily and unjustifiably neurocentric. After rejecting both the FP view, in its pure form, and SI view, in its popular cognitivist renderings, this paper concludes that a more liberal version of SI can accommodate what is best in both views – once SI is so formulated and the FP view properly edited and significantly revised, the two views can be reconciled and combined to provide a sound philosophical basis for a future psychiatry.},

Although it has long been assumed that emotional, social, and cognitive phenomena are realized in the operations of separate brain regions or brain networks, we demonstrate that it is possible to understand the body of neuroimaging evidence using a framework that relies on domain general, distributed structure-function mappings. We review current research in affective and social neuroscience and argue that the emerging science of large-scale intrinsic brain networks provides a coherent framework for a domain-general functional architecture of the human brain.},

abstract = {Sex differences in the relationship between general intelligence and brain structure are a topic of increasing research interest. Early studies focused mainly on gray and white matter differences using voxel-based morphometry, while more recent studies investigated neural fiber tracts using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze the white matter microstructure. In this study we used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) on DTI to test how intelligence is associated with brain diffusion indices and to see whether this relationship differs between men and women. 63 Men and women divided into groups of lower and higher intelligence were selected. Whole-brain DTI scans were analyzed using TBSS calculating maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). The results reveal that the white matter microstructure differs between individuals as a function of intelligence and sex. In men, higher intelligence was related to higher FA and lower RD in the corpus callosum. In women, in contrast, intelligence was not related to the white matter microstructure. The higher values of FA and lower values of RD suggest that intelligence is associated with higher myelination and/or a higher number of axons particularly in men. This microstructural difference in the corpus callosum may increase cognitive functioning by reducing inter-hemispheric transfer time and thus account for more efficient brain functioning in men.},

abstract = {One of the subjects that most concerns physicians is treatment-resistance. About 30{\{}{\%}{\}}-60{\{}{\%}{\}} of schizophrenia patients do not respond adequately to antipsychotic treatment and are known as refractory schizophrenia patients. Clozapine has been the drug of choice in such cases. However, approximately 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of them do not respond to clozapine either. Here, we describe a patient with an initial diagnosis of refractory schizophrenia who had a history of dramatic aggressiveness. However, in this case, "refractoriness" was a wrong diagnosis. A case of psychosis secondary to epilepsy had been treated as schizophrenia for almost 20 years. Reports like this one are important because they remind us of how a thorough investigation can lead to the correct diagnosis and improve the patient's prognosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite the significant burden of delirium among hospitalized adults, there is no approved pharmacologic intervention for delirium. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic interventions targeting either prevention or management of delirium. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) information systems from January 1966 to October 2008. We included randomized, controlled trials comparing pharmacologic compounds either to each other or placebo. We excluded non-comparison trials, studies with patients aged {\textless} 18 years, a history of an Axis I psychiatric disorder, and patients with alcohol-related delirium. REVIEW METHODS: Three reviewers independently extracted the data for participants, interventions and outcome measures, and critically appraised each study using the JADAD scale. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria and evaluated 15 compounds: second-generation antipsychotics, first-generation antipsychotics, cholinergic enhancers, an antiepileptic agent, an inhaled anesthetic, injectable sedatives, and a benzodiazepine. Four trials evaluated delirium treatment and suggested no differences in efficacy or safety among the evaluated treatment methods (first and second generation antipsychotics). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor procholinergic drugs were effective in preventing delirium. Multiple studies, however, suggest either shorter severity and duration, or prevention of delirium with the use of haloperidol, risperidone, gabapentin, or a mixture of sedatives in patients undergoing elective or emergent surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: The existing limited data indicates no superiority for second-generation antipsychotics over haloperidol in managing delirium. Although preliminary results suggest delirium prevention may be accomplished through various mechanisms, further studies are necessary to prove effectiveness.},

@article{Goncalves2016a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although values have increasingly received attention in psychiatric literature over the last three decades, their role has been only partially acknowledged in psychiatric classification endeavors. The review process of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) received harsh criticism, and was even considered secretive by some authors. Also, it lacked an official discussion of values at play. In this perspective paper we briefly discuss the interplay of some values in the scientific and non-scientific debate around one of the most debated DSM-5 category proposals, the Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS). Then, we point out some ethical consequences of a facts-plus-values perspective in psychiatric classification. DISCUSSION: Different stakeholders participated in the APS-debate and for analytical purposes we divided them into four groups: (i) researchers in the field of high-risk mental states; (ii) the DSM-5 Psychotic Disorders Work Group; (iii) patient, carers and advocacy groups; and (iv) external stakeholders, not related to the previous groups, but which also publicly expressed their opinions about APS inclusion in DSM-5. We found that each group differently stressed the role of values we examined in the APS-debate. These values were ethical, but also epistemic, political, economic and ontological. The prominence given to some values, and the lack of discussion about others, generated divergent positions among stakeholders in the debate. As exemplified by the APS discussion, although medicine is primarily an ethical endeavor, values of different kinds that take part in it also shape to a large extent the profession. Thus, it may be strategic to openly discuss values at play in the elaboration of diagnostic tools and classificatory systems. This task, more than scientifically or politically significant, is ethically important.},

abstract = {AIM: To qualitatively examine the common experiences of child and adolescent mental health clinicians working with adolescents suspected of having an 'at-risk mental state' (ARMS) for psychosis. METHODS: A semistructured interview was conducted with six experienced child and adolescent mental health clinicians working in North East England. RESULTS: A thematic analysis of clinicians' experiences indicated that the identification and management of an ARMS within this patient group is particularly complex. In terms of treatment options, approaches that promoted social inclusion were favoured, but the use of antipsychotic medication was perceived as a 'last resort', requiring serious consideration. Clear guidelines and an overall consensus were judged to be lacking in terms of coordinating care and multi-agency working practices. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a formalized care pathway that also incorporates regular training and supervision may be required by this and other clinical services working with adolescents suspected of having an ARMS. Improved identification, a firmer evidence base regarding treatment practices and clear guidelines are required for this age group. This need will become more urgent should a psychosis risk syndrome be included as a diagnostic category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V).},

@article{Kanaan2009b,
abstract = {Background: Dysconnectivity theories of schizophrenia would suggest that the connectivity of the cerebellum is impaired and that the impairment may be restricted to certain tracts. Attempts to examine the structural connectivity of the cerebellum using diffusion tensor imaging have yielded conflicting results. However, previous studies have employed region-of-interest approaches or have used small or unmatched samples, with a consequent risk of type II error. Methods: We conducted an appropriately powered case-control study of 33 patients with schizophrenia and 33 matched healthy control subjects. We used tractography to dissect the four white matter tracts of the cerebellum and measured fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) over each tract for each subject. Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance found that FA was lower in the schizophrenia group compared with the control group, but there were no tract-specific differences between the groups. Mean diffusivity did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: Though structural connectivity is impaired in the cerebellum, it is not local to any particular tract but appears to have a wider, possibly global, distribution. Reduced fractional anisotropy with normal MD would point to the differences being due to disordered neuronal architecture rather than disordered myelination. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

@article{Smith2006,
abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

abstract = {Objective: This article discusses the de- sign, sampling strategy, implementation, and data analytic processes of the DSM-5 Field Trials. Method: The DSM-5 Field Trials were conducted by using a test-retest reliabil- ity design with a stratified sampling ap- proach across six adult and four pediatric sites in the United States and one adult site in Canada. A stratified random sam- pling approach was used to enhance precision in the estimation of the re- liability coefficients. A web-based re- search electronic data capture system was used for simultaneous data collection from patients and clinicians across sites and for centralized data management. Weighted descriptive analyses, intraclass kappa and intraclass correlation coeffi- cients for stratified samples, and receiver operating curves were computed. The DSM-5 Field Trials capitalized on advances since DSM-III and DSM-IV in statistical measures of reliability (i.e., intraclass kappa for stratified samples) and other recently developed measures to determine confi- dence intervals around kappa estimates. Results: Diagnostic interviews using DSM- 5 criteria were conducted by 279 clinicians of varied disciplines who received training comparable to what would be available to any clinician after publication of DSM-5. Overall, 2,246 patientswith various diagno- ses andlevels of comorbiditywere enrolled, of which over 86{\{}{\%}{\}} were seen for two diagnostic interviews. A range of reliability coefficients were observed for the categor- ical diagnoses and dimensionalmeasures.},

METHOD: Four schools with different curricula in three different parts of Canada participated in the study: the University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine, the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine, the Dalhousie University Faculty of Medicine, and the McMaster University Faculty of Health Sciences. All the medical students, residents, and graduate science students at each school were surveyed in 1994-95. The three instruments used were the University of Calgary Stress Questionnaire, the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), and the Symptom Checklist-90. Demographic data were compared across all four schools. Analysis of variance was calculated for all test-item scores, utilizing a four (school) by three (program) by two (gender) design, which were all between subject factors. Significant main effects were followed up by using planned comparisons (Newman-Keuls, with a probability level of p {\{}{\textless}{\}} .05). Significant interaction effects were followed up by using an analysis of simple effects. RESULTS: A total of 1,681 questionnaires were returned as follows: 621 of 1,304 (48{\{}{\%}{\}}) from the medical students, 645 of 1,495 (43{\{}{\%}{\}}) from the residents, and 415 of 829 (50{\{}{\%}{\}}) from the graduate science students. There were significant differences between the three groups in the natures and degrees of stress, with the graduate students reporting higher levels of stress. There were significant gender differences as well, with the women reporting higher levels of stress. Overall, stress levels were found to be mild, based on the University of Calgary Stress Questionnaire and the SRRS. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that medical students and residents experience stress at levels that appear acceptable, but ongoing monitoring and the provision of appropriate support systems will continue to be important.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Voxel-based morphometry is a method for detecting group differences in the density or volume of brain matter. The authors reviewed the literature on use of voxel-based morphometry in schizophrenia imaging research to examine the capabilities of this method for clearly identifying specific structural differences in patients with schizophrenia, compared with healthy subjects. The authors looked for consistently reported results of relative deficits in gray and white matter in schizophrenia and evaluated voxel-based morphometry methods in order to propose a future strategy for using voxel-based morphometry in schizophrenia research. METHOD: The authors reviewed all voxel-based morphometry studies of schizophrenia that were published to May 2004 (15 studies). The studies included a total of 390 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 364 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Gray and white matter deficits in patients with schizophrenia, relative to healthy comparison subjects, were reported in a total of 50 brain regions. Deficits were reported in two of the 50 regions in more than 50{\%} of the studies and in nine of the 50 regions in one study only. The most consistent findings were of relative deficits in the left superior temporal gyrus and the left medial temporal lobe. Use of a smaller smoothing kernel (4-8 mm) led to detection of a greater number of regions implicated in schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: This review implicates the left superior temporal gyrus and the left medial temporal lobe as key regions of structural difference in patients with schizophrenia, compared to healthy subjects. The diversity of regions reported in voxel-based morphometry studies is in part related to the choice of variables in the automated process, such as smoothing kernel size and linear versus affine transformation, as well as to differences in patient groups. Voxel-based morphometry can be used as an exploratory whole-brain approach to identify abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia, which should then be validated by using region-of-interest analyses.},

abstract = {In "Mindblindness," Simon Baron-Cohen presents a model of the evolution and development of "mindreading." He argues that we mindread all the time, effortlessly, automatically, and mostly unconsciously. It is the natural way in which we interpret, predict, and participate in social behavior and communication. We ascribe mental states to people: states such as thoughts, desires, knowledge, and intentions. (from the jacket)Building on many years of research, Baron-Cohen concludes that children with autism suffer from "mindblindness" as a result of a selective impairment in mindreading. For these children the world is essentially devoid of mental things.Baron-Cohen develops a theory that draws on data from comparative psychology, from developmental psychology, and from neuropsychology. He argues that specific neurocognitive mechanisms have evolved that allow us to mindread, to make sense of actions, to interpret gazes as meaningful, and to decode "the language of the eyes."

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychological impairments are well documented in schizophrenia and are important targets of treatment. Information about the severity and pattern of deficits after treatment for the first psychotic episode and about relationships between these deficits and syndromal characteristics remains limited. METHOD: Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments including 41 individual tests were given to 94 patients with first-episode schizophrenia after initial stabilization of psychosis and to a comparison group of 36 healthy volunteers. Profiles of neuropsychological deficits and the relationship of deficits to sex and handedness were examined. Correlations of neuropsychological deficit with a broad range of historical and clinical characteristics, including outcome, were explored. RESULTS: Patients had a large generalized neuropsychological deficit (1.5 standard deviations compared to healthy volunteers). Patients also had, superimposed on the generalized deficit, subtle relative deficits (less than 0.5 standard deviation compared to their own average profile) in memory and executive functions. Learning/memory dysfunction best distinguished patients from healthy individuals; after accounting for this difference, only motor deficits further distinguished the groups. Patients with higher neuropsychological ability had only memory deficits, and patients with lower ability had both memory and executive deficits. No sex differences were observed beyond the normal advantage for men in motor speed. Dextral patients had less severe generalized deficit. Severity of residual symptoms was associated with greater generalized deficit. Executive and attentional deficits were most linked to global functional impairment and poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The results document a large generalized deficit, and more subtle differential deficits, in clinically stabilized first-episode patients. Learning/memory deficits were observed even in patients with less severe generalized deficit, but the pattern was unlike the amnestic syndrome and probably reflects different mechanisms. Executive and attentional deficits marked the more severely disabled patients, and may portend relatively poor outcome. Failure to develop typical patterns of cerebral dominance may increase the risk for greater generalized deficit.},

@article{Vera1999,
abstract = {Ictal SPECT studies are increasingly used to localize seizure foci in children with refractory epilepsy, but few studies have reported on ictal-interictal subtraction images co-registered to MRI at this age. METHODS: Twenty-seven children with partial epilepsy (aged 3 mo-18 y) underwent ictal ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) SPECT (20 mCi/1.73 m2) combined with video-electroencephalography (EEG) and interictal ECD SPECT followed 2 d later by three-dimensional MRI. Ictal-interictal and interictal-ictal subtraction images were computed by registering and normalizing the ictal to the interictal SPECT scans for each child. The ictal, interictal SPECT and subtraction images were registered to each child's MRI. Difference images (ictal-interictal) were then superimposed on MRI for anatomic localization of the perfusion changes. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility and "facility of interpretation" of overlay images were compared with standard analysis of the non-coregistered ictal and interictal scans. RESULTS: Overlay images allowed the detection of at least one hyperperfused focus in 93{\%} of the children, compared with 74{\%} using ictal and interictal scans separately. Seizure onset was suspected clinically, on EEG or on MRI in 20 children. Overlay images were concordant (n = 11) or larger (n = 7) than the suspected focus in 18 of 20 (90{\%}), whereas these images failed to show any abnormality in 1 child and were discordant with MRI in another patient. In the remaining 7, images showed cortical localization in 6 patients. Among the 5 patients who underwent electrocorticography, overlay images were concordant in 3, larger in 1 and absent in 1. The intra- and interobserver reproducibility and facility of interpretation were significantly higher using overlay images than standard analysis, even when ictal and interictal SPECT were co-registered. CONCLUSION: The co-registration of ictal-interictal subtraction SPECT images to MRI seems to be a helpful technique in localizing the onset of seizure and guiding the intracranial recording in childhood epilepsy. Moreover, this method improves sensitivity, enhances intra- and interobserver reproducibility and makes interpretation easier.},

Individuals may be aware of their illness in different ways and this may be related to their functioning. A total of 76 adults with schizophrenia were assessed for their awareness of illness, neurocognition, social cognition, and social function concurrently and social function was also assessed at three later time points. A cluster analysis revealed 3 groups: generally full awareness, generally limited awareness, and superficial awareness. Comparisons between these profiles revealed the superficial group had poorer executive function, emotion recognition ability, and capacity for social relationships than the full awareness group, yet had better verbal memory and more social contacts than the limited awareness group. These results suggest assessing the narrative qualities of awareness of illness may reveal unique links with cognition and function, and this may have implications for interventions.},

abstract = {Neurocognitive deficits are evident both in established schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BP). However, it has been suggested that schizophrenia, but not BP, is characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities that can lead to cognitive deficits at the earliest stages of the illness. The aim of this meta-analytic review was to com- pare neurocognitive deficits in first-episode BP (FEBP) with healthy controls and first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients. The current meta-analysis included a total of 22 adult studies and involved comparisons of 533 FEBP patients with 1417 healthy controls and 605 FEBP and 822 FES patients. FEBP patients were significantly impaired in all cognitive domains (d = 0.26– 0.80) and individual tasks (d = 0.22–0.66) investigated. FES patients significantly underperformed FEBP patients in most cognitive domains (d = 0.05–0.63) and on individual tasks (d = 0.13–0.77). Neuropsychological impairment, which is comparable to chronic BP, was evident in FEBP. Similar to chronic patients, cognitive functions in FEBP lie intermediate between FES and healthy controls. Neurodevelopmental factors are likely to play a significant role not only in schizophrenia but also in BP.},

abstract = {The identification of individuals carrying unexpressed genetic liability to schizophrenia is crucial for both etiological research and clinical risk stratification. Subclinical psychopathological features detectable in the nonpsychotic part of the schizophrenia spectrum could improve the delineation of informative vulnerability phenotypes. Inspired by Meehl's schizotaxia-schizotypy heuristic model, we tested anomalous subjective experiences (self-disorders, SDs) as a candidate vulnerability phenotype in a sample of nonpsychotic, genetically high-risk subjects. A total of 218 unaffected members of 6 extended multiplex families (assessed between 1989 and 1999 during the Copenhagen Schizophrenia Linkage Study) were stratified into 4 groups of increasing psychopathological expressivity: no mental illness (NMI), no mental illness with schizotypal traits (NMI-ST), personality disorders not fulfilling other personality disorders (OPDs), and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). We tested the distribution of SDs among the subgroups, the effect of SDs on the risk of belonging to the different subgroups, and the effect of experimental grouping and concomitant psychopathology (ie, negative symptoms (NSs) and subpsychotic formal thought disorder [FTD]) on the chances of experiencing SDs. SDs distribution followed an incremental pattern from NMI to SPD. SDs were associated with a markedly increased risk of NMI-ST, OPDs, or SPD. The odds of SDs increased as a function of the diagnostic category assignment, independently of sociodemographics and concomitant subclinical psychopathology (NSs and FTD). The results support SDs as an expression of schizotaxic vulnerability and indicate a multidimensional model of schizotypy--characterized by SDs, NSs, FTD--as a promising heuristic construct to address liability phenotypes in genetically high-risk studies.},

They also presented data on how to validate these diagnoses. They termed their endeavor, "The medical model for psychiatric disorders." Residents were taught how to use criteria to diagnose and treat psychiatric patients. Besides clinical interviewing, the emphasis was on published data, critical literature reading and research, either basic or clinical, always using structured interviews. All residents were required to do psychiatric research, supervised by one of the full-time staff. Besides the three above, there were many other faculty members who were actively engaged in teaching and research, but they all adhered to the above model. Repetition was the most important aspect of learning. It was an exciting time to be there and that enthusiasm led to many of the trainees continuing to be committed to academic careers and the others, to a very high standard of psychiatric care. In addition, it led to the development of DSMIII and beyond, a host of validated structured interviews, a method for testing new drugs, a method for validating psychiatric diagnoses, an emphasis on the importance of genetics to psychiatry, and many important clinical findings. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In elderly people, depression mainly affects those with chronic medical illnesses and cognitive impairment, causes suffering, family disruption, and disability, worsens the outcomes of many medical illnesses, and increases mortality. Ageing-related and disease-related processes, including arteriosclerosis and inflammatory, endocrine, and immune changes compromise the integrity of frontostriatal pathways, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, and increase vulnerability to depression. Heredity factors might also play a part. Psychosocial adversity—economic impoverishment, disability, isolation, relocation, caregiving, and bereavement—contributes to physiological changes, further increasing susceptibility to depression or triggering depression in already vulnerable elderly individuals. Treatment with antidepressants is well tolerated by elderly people and is, overall, as effective as in young adults. Evidence-based guidelines for prevention of new episodes of depression are available as are care-delivery systems that increase the likelihood of diagnosis, and improve the treatment of, late-life depression. However, in North America at least, public insurance covers these services inadequately},

In addition to the central role that classical statistical methods play in research using MRI, statistical modeling and machine learning techniques are key to many modern data analysis pipelines. Applications for these techniques cover a broad spectrum of research, including many preclinical and clinical studies, and in some cases these methods are working their way into widespread routine use. In this manuscript we describe a software tool called TractoR (for“Tractography with R”), a collection of packages for the R language and environment, along with additional infrastructure for straightforwardly performing common image processing tasks. TractoR provides general purpose functions for reading, writing and manipulating MR images, as well as more specific code for fitting signal models to diffusion MRI data and performing tractography, a technique for visualizing neural connectivity.},

abstract = {The claim that addiction is a brain disease is almost universally accepted among scientists who work on addiction. The claim's attraction rests on two grounds: the fact that addiction seems to be characterized by dysfunction in specific neural pathways and the fact that the claim seems to the compassionate response to people who are suffering. I argue that neural dysfunction is not sufficient for disease: something is a brain disease only when neural dysfunction is sufficient for impairment. I claim that the neural dysfunction that is characteristic of addiction is not sufficient for impairment, because people who suffer from that dysfunction are impaired, sufficiently to count as diseased, only given certain features of their context. Hence addiction is not a brain disease (though it is often a disease, and it may always involve brain dysfunction). I argue that accepting that addiction is not a brain disease does not entail a moralizing attitude toward people who suffer as a result of addiction; if anything, it allows for a more compassionate, and more effective, response to addiction.},

@phdthesis{CASTRO-DE-ARAUJO2013,
abstract = {Causality is of great importance in medicine and the use of causal voca- bulary is perhaps inevitable. After all, interventions such as prevention and treatment depend, to a large extent, upon the knowledge about the causes of diseases. However, medical scientific literature is seldom explicit about the notions of cause and causal models employed. There seems to be high expectations of finding strong causes for the diseases, i.e., causes that are necessary and sufficient, which are rarely seen in daily practice. In psychiatry, our main concern here, there are many weak causal fac- tors whose determination is, at best, probabilistic. Understanding the causal chain of mental disorders is, therefore, a major challenge, and this equation becomes even more complex if we include in it singular events, such as biographical circumstances. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to analyze, in a philosophically-informed way, the ex- plicit or implicit notions of causality in the current medical scientific literature and to find out which philosophical models of causality prevail in these texts. I also suggest that the causality model of the philosopher John L. Mackie is as an alternative to the exclusive use of statistical models in scientific papers, tendency observed since the seminal work of Bradford-Hill (1964). METHODS AND RESULTS: I reviewed me- dical and philosophical literature through the relevant databases (PubMed and Philo- sophy Index, respectively) and analyzed the concepts of cause used either implicitly or explicitly in the articles. I also made an active search through the references of the articles reviewed and considered as well books of philosophers who have addressed causality. There are important consequences of applying certain ideas of causality on empirical data, such as, for instance, deciding whether or not we should adopt an in- deterministic stance of the world (distinction that implicitly appears in the contrast between the works of Koch and Bradford-Hill, for example). Another key consequen- ce is that statistical models (which are based on regularity) face some difficulties when dealing with events that do not repeat, common occurrence in psychiatry. More- over, the mainstream scientific research in psychiatry is leading to a growing set of empirical data with limited explanatory power about the causality of mental disor- ders. In that regard, the model of the philosopher John L. Mackie, called INUS condi- tion, appear to be very helpful for rearranging the causal elements within a causal fi- eld. Mackie suggests that our notion of cause usually takes peripheral elements to be causally relevant; for him, causality is "necessity in the circumstances." Thus, he defi- nes the notion of INUS condition as a necessary element within a set of conditions, set that is, at its turn, sufficient (though not necessary) for the effect. I explored the notion of INUS condition throughout the text and, to exemplify its feasibility and to stress its advantages, applied it to the hypothetical causal conceptualization of Schi- zophrenia and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.},

Several theoretical and methodological issues relevant to integrating behavior into the model are considered, particularly the distinction between behavior as measured in the laboratory along with neural and psychological processes (proximal behavior) and behavior as measured in situ as part of ongoing daily experience (distal behavior). We conclude by describing several studies that integrate neural, psychological, and behavioral indicators and discuss how these kinds of studies can facilitate a better understanding of behavior and contribute to theory development.},

abstract = {In recent years, combinations of pharmacological treatments have become common for the treatment of bipolar disorder type I (BP I); however, this practice is usually not evidence-based and rarely considers monotherapy drug regimen (MDR) as an option in the treatment of acute phases of BP I. Therefore, we evaluated comparative data of commonly prescribed MDRs for both manic and depressive phases of BP I. Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the ClinicalStudyResults.org and other data sources were searched from 1949 to March 2009 for placebo and active controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Risk ratios (RRs) for response, remission, and discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AEs), lack of efficacy, or discontinuation due to any cause, and the number needed to treat or harm (NNT or NNH) were calculated for each medication individually and for all evaluable trials combined. The authors included 31 RCTs in the analyses comparing a MDR with placebo or with active treatment for acute mania, and 9 RCTs comparing a MDR with placebo or with active treatment for bipolar depression. According to the collected evidence, most of the MDRs when compared to placebo showed significant response and remission rates in acute mania. In the case of bipolar depression only quetiapine and, to a lesser extent, olanzapine showed efficacy as MDR. Overall, MDRs were well tolerated with low discontinuation rates due to any cause or AE, although AE profiles differed among treatments. We concluded that most MDRs were efficacious and safe in the treatment of manic episodes, but very few MDRs have demonstrated being efficacious for bipolar depressive episodes.},

abstract = {During the 19th century and early 20th century, American psychiatry shared many intellectual traditions and values with Great Britain and Europe. These include principles derived from the Enlightenment concerning the dignity of the individual and the value of careful observation. During the 20th century, however, American psychiatry began to diverge, initially due to a much stronger emphasis on psychoanalytic principles, particularly in comparison with Great Britain. By the 1960s and 1970s, studies such as the US-UK study and the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia demonstrated that the psychodynamic emphasis had gone too far, leading to diagnostic imprecision and inadequate evaluation of traditional evaluations of signs and symptoms of psychopathology. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) was developed in this context, under the leadership of representatives from institutions that had retained the more traditional British-European approaches (eg, Washington University, Iowa). The goal of DSM-III was to create a comprehensive system for diagnosing and evaluating psychiatric patients that would be more reliable, more valid, and more consistent with international approaches. This goal was realized in many respects, but unfortunately it also had many unintended consequences. Although the original creators realized that DSM represented a "best effort" rather than a definitive "ground truth," DSM began to be given total authority in training programs and health care delivery systems. Since the publication of DSM-III in 1980, there has been a steady decline in the teaching of careful clinical evaluation that is targeted to the individual person's problems and social context and that is enriched by a good general knowledge of psychopathology. Students are taught to memorize DSM rather than to learn complexities from the great psychopathologists of the past. By 2005, the decline has become so severe that it could be referred to as "the death of phenomenology in the United States."},

abstract = {Psychiatric genetics has taught us a great deal about the nature of psychiatric disorders. Traditional family, twin and adoption studies have demonstrated the substantial role of genetic factors in their etiology, clarified the role of genetic factors in comorbidity, elucidated development pathways, and documented the importance of gene-environment correlation and interaction. We have also received some hard lessons when we were unable to detect replicable genes of large effect size and found that our much-valued candidate genes did not live up to their expected promise. With more mature molecular and statistical methods, we are entering now a different era. Statistical analyses of aggregate molecular signals are validating earlier heritability estimates. Replicated findings from genome-wide association studies are beginning to emerge, as are discoveries of large-effect size rare genomic variants. The number of such findings is likely to soon grow dramatically. The most pressing question facing the field is what biological picture these results will reveal. I articulate four possible scenarios that reflect (i) no, (ii) minimal, (iii) moderate and (iv) high biological coherence in the replicated molecular variant findings, which are soon likely to emerge. I discuss the factors that will likely influence these patterns, including the problems of etiological heterogeneity and multiple realizability. These findings could provide critical insights into the underlying biology of our psychiatric syndromes and potentially permit us to perceive, 'through a glass darkly,' the levels of the mind-brain system that are disordered.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 30 April 2013; doi:10.1038/mp.2013.50.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia has been observed to be associated with various abnormalities in multiple cytokines. Recent genetic analyses showed that the interleukin 3 (IL-3) gene and its receptors are significantly associated with schizophrenia, especially in Irish populations. To examine the associations of the Irish-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, e.g., rs3916441) in the IL-3 gene with schizophrenia in Chinese population, we utilized two independent samples from Southwestern China, including a total 901 schizophrenia patients and 1417 healthy controls. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in allelic or genotypic frequencies of the tested 6 SNPs in IL-3 between cases and controls in any sample. Therefore, the results of our analyses were not able to confirm the association of IL-3 SNPs with schizophrenia. The absence of the IL-3's association in Chinese population suggest a potential genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizophrenia on this locus and also demonstrate the difficulties in replicating associations of schizophrenia across different ethnic populations.},

The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of methylphenidate treatment of adult ADHD and to examine the influence of methods on meta-analytic results. Electronic databases were searched to identify clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo in the treatment of adult ADHD. Studies were summarised with meta-analytic methods. Subgroup analyses were conducted with respect to parallel group versus cross-over trials and self versus observer ratings. The relationship between dosage and effect size was explored by weighted regression analysis. The results were tested for publication bias, and several sensitivity analyses were performed. Findings and methods were compared with a previous meta-analysis. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria of which 16 were included in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size (d = 0.42) was significantly different from zero, but was only half the size expected on the basis of a previous meta-analysis. No significant differences could be observed in the subgroup analyses. The regression analysis showed no significant influence of mean daily dose on effect size. These results contradict findings of a previous meta-analysis and challenge guideline recommendations. Methodological issues in meta-analyses are discussed.},

@article{Sass2003,
abstract = {In recent years, there has been much focus on the apparent heterogeneity of schizophrenic symptoms. By contrast, this article proposes a unifying account emphasizing basic abnormalities of consciousness that underlie and also antecede a disparate assortment of signs and symptoms. Schizophrenia, we argue, is fundamentally a self-disorder or ipseity disturbance (ipse is Latin for "self" or "itself") that is characterized by complementary distortions of the act of awareness: hyperreflexivity and diminished self-affection. Hyperreflexivity refers to forms of exaggerated self-consciousness in which aspects of oneself are experienced as akin to external objects. Diminished self-affection or self-presence refers to a weakened sense of existing as a vital and self-coinciding source of awareness and action. This article integrates recent psychiatric research and European phenomenological psychiatry with some current work in cognitive science and phenomenological philosophy. After introducing the phenomenological approach along with a theoretical account of normal consciousness and self-awareness, we turn to a variety of schizophrenic syndromes. We examine positive, then negative, and finally disorganization symptoms-attempting in each case to illuminate shared distortions of consciousness and the sense of self. We conclude by discussing the possible relevance of this approach for identifying early schizophrenic symptoms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Brazilian public health system does not provide electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is limited to a few academic services. National mental health policies are against ECT. Our objectives were to analyze critically the public policies toward ECT and present the current situation using statistics from the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (IPq-HCFMUSP) and summary data from the other 13 ECT services identified in the country. METHODS: Data regarding ECT treatment at the IPq-HCFMUSP were collected from January 2009 to June 2010 (demographical, number of sessions, and diagnoses). All the data were analyzed using SPSS 19, Epic Info 2000, and Excel. RESULTS: During this period, 331 patients were treated at IPq-HCFMUSP: 221 (67{\%}) were from S{\~{a}}o Paulo city, 50 (15.2{\%}) from S{\~{a}}o Paulo's metropolitan area, 39 (11.8{\%}) from S{\~{a}}o Paulo's countryside, and 20 (6.1{\%}) from other states; 7352 ECT treatments were delivered-63.0{\%} (4629) devoted entirely via the public health system (although not funded by the federal government); the main diagnoses were a mood disorder in 86.4{\%} and schizophrenia in 7.3{\%} of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: There is an important lack of public assistance for ECT, affecting mainly the poor and severely ill patients. The university services are overcrowded and cannot handle all the referrals. The authors press for changes in the mental health policies.},

@article{Banerjee2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is common in dementia but the evidence base for appropriate drug treatment is sparse and equivocal. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of two of the most commonly prescribed drugs, sertraline and mirtazapine, compared with placebo. METHODS: We undertook the parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Health Technology Assessment Study of the Use of Antidepressants for Depression in Dementia (HTA-SADD) trial in participants from old-age psychiatry services in nine centres in England. Participants were eligible if they had probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, depression (lasting ≥4 weeks), and a Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD) score of 8 or more. Participants were ineligible if they were clinically critical (eg, suicide risk), contraindicated to study drugs, on antidepressants, in another trial, or had no carer. The clinical trials unit at King's College London (UK) randomly allocated participants with a computer-generated block randomisation sequence, stratified by centre, with varying block sizes, in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive sertraline (target dose 150 mg per day), mirtazapine (45 mg), or placebo (control group), all with standard care. The primary outcome was reduction in depression (CSDD score) at 13 weeks (outcomes to 39 weeks were also assessed), assessed with a mixed linear-regression model adjusted for baseline CSDD, time, and treatment centre. This study is registered, number ISRCTN88882979 and EudraCT 2006-000105-38. FINDINGS: Decreases in depression scores at 13 weeks did not differ between 111 controls and 107 participants allocated to receive sertraline (mean difference 1{\textperiodcentered}17, 95{\%} CI -0{\textperiodcentered}23 to 2{\textperiodcentered}58; p=0{\textperiodcentered}10) or mirtazapine (0{\textperiodcentered}01, -1{\textperiodcentered}37 to 1{\textperiodcentered}38; p=0{\textperiodcentered}99), or between participants in the mirtazapine and sertraline groups (1{\textperiodcentered}16, -0{\textperiodcentered}25 to 2{\textperiodcentered}57; p=0{\textperiodcentered}11); these findings persisted to 39 weeks. Fewer controls had adverse reactions (29 of 111 [26{\%}]) than did participants in the sertraline group (46 of 107, 43{\%}; p=0{\textperiodcentered}010) or mirtazapine group (44 of 108, 41{\%}; p=0{\textperiodcentered}031), and fewer serious adverse events rated as severe (p=0{\textperiodcentered}003). Five patients in every group died by week 39. INTERPRETATION: Because of the absence of benefit compared with placebo and increased risk of adverse events, the present practice of use of these antidepressants, with usual care, for first-line treatment of depression in Alzheimer's disease should be reconsidered.

abstract = {The computer analogy of the mind has been as widely adopted in contemporary cognitive neuroscience as was the analogy of the brain as a collection of organs in phrenology. Just as the phrenologist would insist that each organ must have its particular function, so contemporary cognitive neuroscience is committed to the notion that each brain region must have its fundamental computation. In After Phrenology, Michael Anderson argues that to achieve a fully post-phrenological science of the brain, we need to reassess this commitment and devise an alternate, neuroscientifically grounded taxonomy of mental function. Anderson contends that the cognitive roles played by each region of the brain are highly various, reflecting different neural partnerships established under different circumstances. He proposes quantifying the functional properties of neural assemblies in terms of their dispositional tendencies rather than their computational or information-processing operations. Exploring larger-scale issues, and drawing on evidence from embodied cognition, Anderson develops a picture of thinking rooted in the exploitation and extension of our early-evolving capacity for iterated interaction with the world. He argues that the multidimensional approach to the brain he describes offers a much better fit for these findings, and a more promising road toward a unified science of minded organisms.},

abstract = {In face of the multiple controversies surrounding the DSM process in general and the development of DSM-5 in particular, we have organized a discussion around what we consider six essential questions in further work on the DSM. The six questions involve: 1) the nature of a mental disorder; 2) the definition of mental disorder; 3) the issue of whether, in the current state of psychiatric science, DSM-5 should assume a cautious, conservative posture or an assertive, transformative posture; 4) the role of pragmatic considerations in the construction of DSM-5; 5) the issue of utility of the DSM - whether DSM-III and IV have been designed more for clinicians or researchers, and how this conflict should be dealt with in the new manual; and 6) the possibility and advisability, given all the problems with DSM-III and IV, of designing a different diagnostic system. Part 1 of this article took up the first two questions. Part 2 took up the second two questions. Part 3 now deals with Questions 5 {\{}{\&}{\}} 6. Question 5 confronts the issue of utility, whether the manual design of DSM-III and IV favors clinicians or researchers, and what that means for DSM-5. Our final question, Question 6, takes up a concluding issue, whether the acknowledged problems with the earlier DSMs warrants a significant overhaul of DSM-5 and future manuals. As in Parts 1 {\{}{\&}{\}} 2 of this article, the general introduction, as well as the introductions and conclusions for the specific questions, are written by James Phillips, and the responses to commentaries are written by Allen Frances.},

abstract = {Objective. Childhood maltreatment and familial psychopathology both lead to an increased risk of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood. While family history of psychopathology has traditionally been viewed as a proxy for genetic predisposition, such pathology can also contribute to a stress-laden environment for the child. Method. Analyses were conducted to evaluate the joint effect of childhood abuse and a family history of major depressive disorder (MDD) on diagnoses of PTSD and MDD in a sample of 225 adults with DSM-IV Axis II disorders. Results. Results showed that the rate of PTSD in the presence of both childhood abuse and MDD family history was almost six-fold (OR = 5.89, P = .001) higher relative to the absence of both factors. In contrast, the rate of MDD in the presence of both factors was associated with a nearly three-fold risk relative to the reference group (OR = 2.75, P = .01). Conclusions. The results from this observational study contribute to a growing understanding of predisposing factors for the development of PTSD and suggest that joint effects of family history of MDD and childhood abuse on PTSD are greater than either factor alone.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Purpose: Glucocorticoids have particularly strong impact on the thromboembolic complications. A factor which increases the risk of thrombosis is hyperhomocysteinemia, observed in patients with hypercortisolemia. Proinflammatory factors also affect the haemostatic balance. There has been an extensive research which estimates hemostatic system in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Undoubtedly, much fewer publications are available on thromboembolic complications in patients with Subclinical Cushing's Syndrome (SCS). The purpose of this study was to estimate of homocysteine (HCY) and alpha-1 antitrypsin ($\alpha$1ATp) concentrations in patients with SCS. Materials and methods: We studied 35 patients (56.0 ± 15.0 years) with SCS and 33 healthy volunteers (53.3 ± 17.7 years). In all subjects the analysis of HCY and $\alpha$1ATp concentration in serum was determined with an immunonephelometric method. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: A comparison of HCY and $\alpha$1ATp mean concentrations in patients with SCS and healthy representatives indicated statistically higher values of both analysed parameters in the sera of patients than in the healthy controls (p values were 0.018 and 0.008, respectively). In the patients with SCS a negative correlation between $\alpha$1ATp and cortisol concentration in overnight dexamethasone test was found (p=0.017, R=-0.40). We did not reveal any statistically significant correlation between the concentrations of HCY and $\alpha$1ATp, and coagulation parameters such as INR, APTT, fibrinogen concentration in patients with SCS. Conclusions: On the basis of the obtained results, a slight increase in the concentration of homocysteine and $\alpha$1ATp is observed in patients with SCS, which may influence vascular complications.},

abstract = {Many previous studies have found associations between poor cognitive function and schizophrenia. However, the majority of these studies used retrospective data, leading to the possibility of selection and recall biases. Retrospective studies are also unable to distinguish whether cognitive deficits exist prior to the onset of schizophrenia, suggesting that they are important in etiology, or following onset, suggesting that they are secondary to the disorder or its treatment. The current review used a systematic search strategy to identify and summarize the results of all studies that have used population-based cohorts to examine associations between prospectively collected data on premorbid cognitive functioning in childhood or adolescence and subsequent risk for schizophrenia. Three broad categories of study have addressed these questions: birth cohort designs with cognitive testing during childhood, army conscript designs with cognitive performance measured at conscription, and studies using school grades. Birth cohort and conscript studies are consistent in reporting strong associations between poor performance on cognitive batteries and increased risk of schizophrenia. Studies on school performance have been less consistent, although the largest such study showed strong associations across all school subjects. In conclusion, children and adolescents with poor cognitive abilities in childhood are at increased risk of schizophrenia. This suggests that poor cognitive function is either directly causal or associated with causal factors that are involved in etiology.},

abstract = {Highly accurate surface models of the cerebral cortex are becoming increasingly important as tools in the investigation of the functional organization of the human brain. The construction of such models is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel misclassifications can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model. These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening, or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model, but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate models. In order to address this need we have developed a technique for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically correct.},

Research is distinguished from ordinary clinical practice by the intention to advance knowledge. So defined, research with psychiatric patients should be governed by the same four principles as research with any other group--knowledge, necessity, benefit and consent. In applying these principles, however, particularly the principle of consent, many acute difficulties are raised by psychiatric patients. A number of proposals for addressing these difficulties are discussed. It is suggested that, notwithstanding the value of published guidelines, and the help that may be available from research ethics committees, the primary responsibility for maintaining high standards of practice in research rests with research workers themselves.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sexual dimorphism in human brain structure is well recognised, but less is known about gender differences in white matter microstructure. We used diffusion tensor imaging to explore gender differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of microstructural integrity. We previously found increased FA in the corpus callosum in women, and increased FA in the cerebellum and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in men, using a whole-brain voxel-based analysis.

METHODS: A whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analysis of 120 matched subjects from the previous analysis, and 134 new subjects (147 men and 107 women in total) using a 1.5T scanner, with division into tract-based regions of interest.

RESULTS: Men had higher FA in the superior cerebellar peduncles and women had higher FA in corpus callosum in both the first and second samples. The higher SLF FA in men was not found in either sample.

DISCUSSION: We confirmed our previous, controversial finding of increased FA in the corpus callosum in women, and increased cerebellar FA in men. The corpus callosum FA difference offers some explanation for the otherwise puzzling advantage in inter-callosal transfer time shown in women; the cerebellar FA difference may be associated with the developmental motor advantage shown in men.},

Further, improved short-term test-retest reliability was noted when using the DSM-5, in comparison to DSM-IV, criteria for binge eating disorder. Thus, these studies found that trained interviewers can reliably diagnose eating disorders using the proposed DSM-5 criteria; however, additional data from general practice settings and community samples are needed.},

Broad ADHD adds to that definition those meeting subthreshold criteria. Cronbach's alpha is .90 for the 18 DSM-IV symptoms in childhood and .88 when rated for current symptoms in adulthood. No one item unduly influences the reliability of the total score. The authors find similar results in separate analyses of hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive symptoms.

A latent growth curve model was used to identify differences in depression symptomatology at baseline and over time. Logistic regression analyses were used to predict clinically significant depressive symptomatology at each wave based on CVB, education, and the education × CVB interaction. RESULTS: Results indicate that among older women, greater educational attainment predicted fewer depression symptoms at baseline, but this advantage was partially eroded over time. The education × CVB interaction predicted clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline when the benefits of education were most robust.Discussion.Brain reserve, characterized by educational attainment, may counterbalance the effect of high CVB with respect to depressive symptoms, thereby preserving mood in late life. These findings support the application of brain reserve theory to late-life depression.},

abstract = {Although personality disorders (PDs) have been defined categorically throughout the history of psychiatric nomenclatures, the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group proposed a substantial shift to a dimensional conceptualization and diagnosis of personality pathology. This proposal included the adoption of a trait model with 37 specific traits that fell within six higher-order domains. In addition, they specified that half of the current diagnoses be recast as types defined by narrative description, with the other half deleted. Instead, the deleted categories would be diagnosed through ratings on specifically assigned traits. The Work Group also spec- ified a number of traits that are relevant to each of the five DSM-5 types. However, these assignments for the types and deleted DSMIV PDs lack empirical justification. The current study examined the relations between the DSM-5 traits and PDs slated for inclusion and exclusion using an expert consensus approach. Researchers with exper- tise on specific PDs provided descriptions of either the DSM-5 type narratives or a prototypic case of DSMIV PDs in terms of the trait model. The ratings by experts in the current study demonstrated moderate agreement with the Work Groups assign- ments, but also identified notable discrepancies between how these types were de- scribed by the Work Group and how they were perceived by other PD researchers. These results hold promise for improving the currently proposed system and will help inform researchers and clinicians who will ultimately use the DSM-5 model.},

abstract = {There is some evidence that older adults respond to emotional stimuli differently to young adults, and that they may exhibit better performance on measures of memory and attention when stimuli are positive rather than negative in valence. A relation between cortisol levels and attention/memory for emotional stimuli in young adults has also been reported. The relationship between cortisol levels and the judgment of facial expressions of emotion in aging, however, has yet to be explored. The aim of this study was to investigate performance on a simple emotional face judgment task in young (N=37) and middle-aged (N=37) adults in association with salivary cortisol levels. Middle-aged participants were slower in responding to stimuli than younger participants. Cortisol levels were found to be associated with shorter response latencies to categorise emotional but not neutral faces, and with a greater tendency to judge neutral faces as being emotional. An interaction between age and cortisol levels emerged in response to angry faces; such that higher cortisol levels predicted significantly shorter reaction times to angry faces in young adults, but not in middle-aged adults. Thus, cortisol may be differently related to the processing of emotional facial expressions, particularly of anger, in middle-aged and young individuals. The findings are discussed in relation to the hypothesised changes in emotion regulation with aging.},

The commentary then engages the articles in this special section, beginning with a response to Berenbaum's concern that the RDoC approach to sorting constructs across multiple units of analysis espouses a de facto biological fundamentalism. This leads us to delineate the relationship between RDoC and the NIMH priorities relevant to this initiative. The commentary then considers how Patrick's iterative "construct-network" method can be applied to RDoC construct validation, highlighting several aspects that are particularly useful. One aspect of this work involves determining subject inclusion and exclusion criteria that provide an appropriate range of variance. Finally, this commentary considers the Bilder group's article, explicating the ways in which multilevel models can foster development of hypotheses and informatics approaches needed for further RDoC progress.},

@article{Cartwright2010,
abstract = {What kinds of evidence reliably support predictions of effectiveness for health and social care interventions? There is increasing reliance, not only for health care policy and practice but also for more general social and economic policy deliberation, on evidence that comes from studies whose basic logic is that of JS Mill's method of difference. These include randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, and some uses of causal Bayes nets and counterfactual-licensing models like ones commonly developed in econometrics. The topic of this paper is the 'external validity' of causal conclusions from these kinds of studies. We shall argue two claims. Claim, negative: external validity is the wrong idea; claim, positive: 'capacities' are almost always the right idea, if there is a right idea to be had. If we are right about these claims, it makes big problems for policy decisions. Many advice guides for grading policy predictions give top grades to a proposed policy if it has two good Mill's-method-of difference studies that support it. But if capacities are to serve as the conduit for support from a method-of-difference study to an effectiveness prediction, much more evidence, and much different in kind, is required. We will illustrate the complexities involved with the case of multisystemic therapy, an internationally adopted intervention to try to diminish antisocial behaviour in young people.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antipsychotics have been widely used in the treatment of bipolar mania. The purpose of this manuscript was to briefly review the evidence of typical and atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of bipolar mania. METHODS: A detailed literature review was conducted on the use of typical and atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar mania using standard search engines. A summary of the published literature on each agent is described followed by a discussion on the overall comparison of the different agents. RESULTS: For typical antipsychotics, up until recently, there was a paucity of published evidence on their strengths and limitations in the treatment of bipolar mania. Recent studies have demonstrated clear evidence on the efficacy of haloperidol on the treatment of acute mania. The literature suggests a faster onset of action of haloperidol as compared to either lithium or atypical antipsychotics. A limitation of typical antipsychotics however, is the risk of tardive dyskinesia, extrapyramidal side effects and a possible increased risk of non-adherence. Evidence on the efficacy for atypical antipsychotics has been demonstrated for aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. Limitations as regards the use of atypical antipsychotics include the risk of weight gain and dyslipidemia. Comparison among different atypical antipsychotics agents are difficult to determine as there are no conclusive head to head studies. There is also a paucity of studies comparing atypical antipsychotics with lithium. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence exists on the efficacy of both typical and atypical antipsychotics on the treatment of acute mania such that they are now clearly first-line along with lithium. An important limitation of the published literature is that most of the studies were designed to obtain regulatory approval for the different agents therefore the generalizability of the findings to clinical practice remains unclear.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PSTD), classified as an anxiety disorder, has become increasingly important because of wars overseas, natural disasters, and domestic violence. After trauma exposes the victim to actual or threatened death or serious injury, 3 dimensions of PTSD unfold: (1) reexperiencing the event with distressing recollections, dreams, flashbacks, and/or psychologic and physical distress; (2) persistent avoidance of stimuli that might invite memories or experiences of the trauma; and (3) increased arousal. Traumatic events sufficient to produce PTSD in susceptible subjects may reach a lifetime prevalence of 50{\{}{\%}{\}} to 90{\{}{\%}{\}}. The actual lifetime prevalence of PTSD among US citizens is approximately 8{\{}{\%}{\}}, with the clinical course driven by pathophysiologic changes in the amygdala and hippocampus. Comorbid depression and other anxiety disorders are common. General principles of treatment include the immediate management of PTSD symptoms and signs; management of any trauma-related comorbid conditions; nonpharmacologic interventions including cognitive behavioral treatment; and psychopharmacologic agents including antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors most commonly), antianxiety medications, mood stabilizing drugs, and antipsychotics. This review of PTSD will provide the reader with a clearer understanding of this condition, an increased capacity to recognize and treat this syndrome, and a greater appreciation for the role of the internist in PTSD.},

abstract = {Current literature on the effects of chronic stress in general health converges to the concept of allostatic load (AL). AL is the bodily 'wear and tear' that emerges with sustained allostatic states. In the field of bipolar disorder (BD), AL offers an important clue as to why patients who undergo recurrent mood episodes are clinically perceived as less resilient. In addition, AL helps explaining the cumulative disruptive health effects of intermittent episodes and stressors. Stress- and episode-induced changes in brain regions involved in the emotional circuitry may lead to dysfunctional processing of information, which would render BD patients more vulnerable to subsequent environmental stressors, episodes, and drugs of abuse. Mood stabilizing agents exert opposite effects than chronic stress in neurons, increasing neuroprotective factors what may help to quench the cycle of affective episode recurrence and neural and bodily deterioration. Therefore, AL provides an explanatory link to apparently unrelated findings such as cognitive impairment and higher rates of physical comorbidity and mortality that are observed in the course of BD and further highlight the importance of effective long-term prophylaxis.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising method for characterizing microstructural changes or differences with neuropathology and treatment. The diffusion tensor may be used to characterize the magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the orientation of directional diffusion. This review addresses the biological mechanisms, acquisition, and analysis of DTI measurements. The relationships between DTI measures and white matter pathologic features (e.g., ischemia, myelination, axonal damage, inflammation, and edema) are summarized. Applications of DTI to tissue characterization in neurotherapeutic applications are reviewed. The interpretations of common DTI measures (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional anisotropy, FA; radial diffusivity, D(r); and axial diffusivity, D(a)) are discussed. In particular, FA is highly sensitive to microstructural changes, but not very specific to the type of changes (e.g., radial or axial). To maximize the specificity and better characterize the tissue microstructure, future studies should use multiple diffusion tensor measures (e.g., MD and FA, or D(a) and D(r)).},

abstract = {Research advances in psychiatric genetics have raised expectations that genetic findings might lead to major breakthroughs in psychiatric nosology. The author reviews the plausibility of these claims. Four areas are addressed. First, it is argued that familial aggregation of a single putative psychiatric syndrome provides at best limited evidence for the validity of that syndrome. Second, both traditional and molecular genetic strategies can supply important insights into major diagnostic conundrums. However, evidence that one or a few individual genes impact on risk for two disorders is not likely to resolve definitively the nosologic relationship between the two syndromes. Third, while gene-based essentialist models for psychiatric disorders are conceptually appealing, they are not well supported empirically. Gene discovery in psychiatry is, on its own, unlikely to allow us to "carve nature at its joints," thereby validating categorical psychiatric diagnoses. Fourth, the project to ground "messy" psychiatric categories on the firm foundation of genes-as an archetypal natural kind-may be fundamentally flawed because the very concept of "the gene" as a discrete entity is itself increasingly in doubt. Whereas psychiatric genetics has and will continue to provide important insights into the etiology of psychiatric and substance use disorders, it is not likely alone to provide deep answers to the complex and multifaceted problems facing psychiatric nosology.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The choice of pharmacological treatment for the approximately 50 million people in the United States with hypertension has important therapeutic and financial implications. OBJECTIVES: To describe national antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns for 1992 and 1995; to explore the influence of the Fifth Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V), published in 1993, which recommended diuretics and beta-blockers as first-line antihypertensive therapy unless contraindicated; and to estimate the impact of these prescribing patterns on the cost of antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN: All prescriptions for drugs approved for the treatment of hypertension dispensed by 35000 retail pharmacies were tabulated for 1992 and 1995 (62{\{}{\%}{\}} of all US retail pharmacies were surveyed). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of prescriptions for each dosage form of medication and national cost estimates based on wholesale costs of medications dispensed. RESULTS: In 1992, of the 10 most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs, 3 were calcium antagonists, 3 were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 3 were beta-blockers, and 1 was the combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. In 1995, 4 were calcium antagonists, 3 were ACE inhibitors, 1 was a beta-blocker, 1 was the combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, and 1 an alpha-blocker. In 1992, calcium antagonists accounted for 33{\{}{\%}{\}} of antihypertensive prescriptions compared with 38{\{}{\%}{\}} in 1995, ACE inhibitor use went from 25{\{}{\%}{\}} to 33{\{}{\%}{\}}, beta-blocker use from 18{\{}{\%}{\}} to 11{\{}{\%}{\}}, and diuretic use from 16{\{}{\%}{\}} to 8{\{}{\%}{\}}. The estimated wholesale costs for calcium antagonists in 1995 dollars increased from {\{}{\$}{\}}2.67 billion in 1992 to {\{}{\$}{\}}2.86 billion in 1995; ACE inhibitor costs increased from {\{}{\$}{\}}1.37 billion to {\{}{\$}{\}}1.67 billion; costs for diuretics declined from {\{}{\$}{\}}353 million to {\{}{\$}{\}}168 million; and costs for beta-blockers declined from {\{}{\$}{\}}763 million to {\{}{\$}{\}}433 million. CONCLUSIONS: From 1992 to 1995 use of calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors for treatment of hypertension increased and diuretics and beta-blockers declined, suggesting that the recommendations from JNC V had little effect on prescribing patterns. The cost implications of these practice patterns are enormous.},

abstract = {In biology, man is an object of research; therefore the question might be asked whether inspirations can go from biological data to the reflections on the mind-matter relation in man. The social aspect of man, as treated by sociobiology, is left out of consideration. The knowledge that man is mind, or has a mind, is no result of biological research. It is a datum from philosophy. The biologist, however, is living in a culture which knows about the mental character of man, and this is incorporated in his investigations. He knows that mental activities are connected with processes in the central nervous system and that, especially in the brain, localizations of mental activities are found. As a result of the split-brain experiments with patients and animals, some have arrived at the conclusion that there is a double consciousness. An approach from biology can lead to statements of a philosophical character, as, for example, statements about the unity, or even identity, of mind and matter. The theories of identity meet with great interest in scientific circles, and the truth value of identity statements is investigated. The system theory is taken into consideration. On a philosophical level a revaluation of the concept of matter can lead to a different sort of identity theory.},

abstract = {The variable results of positive-negative research with schizophrenics underscore the importance of well-characterized, standardized measurement techniques. We report on the development and initial standardization of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for typological and dimensional assessment. Based on two established psychiatric rating systems, the 30-item PANSS was conceived as an operationalized, drug-sensitive instrument that provides balanced representation of positive and negative symptoms and gauges their relationship to one another and to global psychopathology. It thus constitutes four scales measuring positive and negative syndromes, their differential, and general severity of illness. Study of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be normally distributed and supported their reliability and stability. Positive and negative scores were inversely correlated once their common association with general psychopathology was extracted, suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive constructs. Review of five studies involving the PANSS provided evidence of its criterion-related validity with antecedent, genealogical, and concurrent measures, its predictive validity, its drug sensitivity, and its utility for both typological and dimensional assessment.},

@article{Howes2009,
abstract = {The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a cross-section approach we investigated prescription practice in acute mania in 63 German, Swiss and Austrian hospitals between 1994 and 2004. METHODS: Our data were gathered from a large drug safety program (AMSP) within which on two reference days each year all administered drugs are recorded. For the present study, all cases with a primary diagnosis of acute euphoric mania (n=1291) or mixed-state mania (n=143) were identified. Prescription rates from two periods, 1994 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004, were compared. RESULTS: In euphoric mania, prescription of lithium decreased by about one-fifth (43.3{\{}{\%}{\}} to 34.5{\{}{\%}{\}}, p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01), while prescription of anticonvulsants increased by one-half (from 40.0{\{}{\%}{\}} to 60.7{\{}{\%}{\}}, p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.001). Administration of atypical antipsychotics more than doubled (18.5{\{}{\%}{\}} to 43.9{\{}{\%}{\}}, p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.001), while use of typical antipsychotics decreased significantly (56.9{\{}{\%}{\}} to 27.8{\{}{\%}{\}}, p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.001). Overall prescription rates of antipsychotics (79.6{\{}{\%}{\}} vs. 81.6{\{}{\%}{\}}) and antidepressants (14.0{\{}{\%}{\}} vs. 15.5{\{}{\%}{\}}) remained stable, while administration of tranquilizers increased significantly (26.3{\{}{\%}{\}} to 34.3{\{}{\%}{\}}, p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01). In mixed-state mania, similar trends over time to those seen in euphoric mania were observed for lithium (43.2{\{}{\%}{\}} to 33.3{\{}{\%}{\}}), anticonvulsants (50.0{\{}{\%}{\}} to 69.7{\{}{\%}{\}}, p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.05) and tranquilizers (22.7{\{}{\%}{\}} to 40.4{\{}{\%}{\}}). Prescription rates of antipsychotics slightly increased (63.6{\{}{\%}{\}} to 72.7{\{}{\%}{\}}), while prescription of antidepressants slightly decreased (54.5{\{}{\%}{\}} to 46.5{\{}{\%}{\}}). Polypharmacy was a common phenomenon: patients with euphoric mania were treated with a mean number of 2.9+/-1.2 psychotropic agents, and patients with mixed-state mania with 3.3+/-1.5 psychotropic agents. Both groups showed a significant increase over time. Second-generation atypical antipsychotics were adopted quite rapidly for the treatment of acute mania considering the availability of the scientific evidence at that time. Off-label use was a common phenomenon. Deviations from recommended guidelines were found mainly in the use of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs both in mixed-state and euphoric mania. CONCLUSIONS: Naturalistic prescription studies like this may encourage a critical scrutiny of clinical treatment habits and may also drive further research thus moderating potential differences between evidence-based knowledge and everyday clinical practice.},

We conducted structural equation modeling on data from a large (n = 1,091), longitudinal sample, with a measure of intelligence at age 11 years and 10 tests covering a diverse range of cognitive abilities taken at age 70. Results indicated that the association of education with improved cognitive test scores is not mediated by g, but consists of direct effects on specific cognitive skills.

Structural MRI imaging confirmed marked frontal atrophy involving particularly the ventromedial region. Performance on standard tests of frontal executive function was largely unremarkable and MW obtained a perfect score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In contrast, an experimental battery of tasks designed to evaluate theory of mind (ToM) revealed marked deficits. MW's challenging and disruptive behaviours, notably obsessive checking of car suspension by rocking, and wandering, responded to behavioural modification regimes adapted from the neurorehabilitation literature. In conclusion, deficits in ToM may underline the gross abnormalities in social conduct, which characterise fv-FTD; ToM appears to dissociate from frontal executive function; and behavioural modification approaches can be of benefit in this disorder.},

METHOD: Patients with a first episode of psychosis who were consecutively admitted to a hospital (N = 102) were examined for the presence of psychiatric and medical disorders. Patients were given psychiatric diagnoses with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R and were rated weekly on symptom rating scales. Outcome variables at discharge were final symptom rating scale scores, length of hospitalization, and recovery on the basis of operationalized criteria. RESULTS: Comorbid diagnoses were present in 52.0{\%} (N = 53) of the patients, and 37.7{\%} (N = 20) had multiple comorbid diagnoses. The most common comorbid diagnosis was substance abuse. Patients with affected psychoses were significantly more likely than those with nonaffective psychoses to have a comorbid substance abuse diagnosis. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity had poorer initial outcomes, while those with medical comorbidity had fewer symptoms at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity is common and may be a useful predictor of the outcome of a first episode of psychosis.},

abstract = {In recent decades the community mental health movement has achieved a dramatic reduction in the census of state and county mental hospitals in the United States, and hundreds of federally-funded community mental health centers have been established nationwide. At the same time, national controversy has arisen in response to what in places has seemed the haphazard process of implementing "deinstitutionalization" and the fate of many chronically mentally ill persons who are without needed social services and psychological care. Despite the widespread attention that this contemporary program has received, theoretical analysis of the complex social, scientific, intellectual, and political origins of America's community mental health policy remains deficient. This article examines the background and development of the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963, tracing how an important shift in national policy toward the mentally ill grew out of changing perceptions--among policymakers, professional groups, and the general citizenry in the post-World War II era--of the nature of the problem of mental illness.},

abstract = {The delusional misidentification syndromes, occurring within the context of different nosological settings, such as schizophrenia, are psychopathological phenomena related to the experience of depersonalisation/derealisation. Extensive research indicates that individuals meeting specific "prodromal" criteria, such as attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief intermittent psychotic symptoms, or functional decline and family history of schizophrenia have increased risk for impending psychosis. Despite depersonalisation and/or derealisation often precede psychotic onset, they are not included among the prodromal criteria of the Australian-American approach. A 17-year-old boy with acute agitation, violent behaviour and aggression, and dissociative amnesia had a mild verbal memory impairment and temporo-limbic hypometabolism on the positron-emission tomography. The patient was assessed with both the ultra-high risk (UHR) and the basic symptom approaches and was not found to be prodromal with imminent risk of transition to psychosis. He was hospitalised briefly and 2 weeks after discharge he developed delusional misidentification. This case shows that even the integration of both UHR and basic symptoms criteria may give false negatives in the prediction of psychosis, especially in those cases in which a long prodromal phase is absent.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular changes and glucocorticoid mediated hippocampal atrophy are considered relevant for depression-related cognitive deficits, forming putative treatment targets. AIMS: This study examined the relative contribution of cortisol levels, brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities to the persistence of cognitive deficits in older adults with depression. METHOD: Thirty-five people aged {\textgreater} or =60 years with DSM-IV major depression and twenty-nine healthy comparison controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were followed up for 18 months. We analysed the relationship between baseline salivary cortisol levels, whole brain, frontal lobe and hippocampal volumes, severity of white matter hyperintensities and follow-up cognitive function in both groups by testing the interaction between the groups and these biological measures on tests of memory, executive functions and processing speed in linear regression models. RESULTS: Group differences in memory and executive function follow-up scores were associated with ratings of white matter hyperintensities, especially of the deep white matter and periventricular regions. Compared with healthy controls, participants with depression scoring within the third tertile of white matter hyperintensities dropped two and three standard deviations in executive function and memory scores respectively. No biological measure related to group differences in processing speed, and there were no significant interactions between group and cortisol levels, or volumetric MRI measures. CONCLUSIONS: White matter hyperintensities, rather than cortisol levels or brain atrophy, are associated with continuing cognitive impairments in older adults with depression. The findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease rather than glucocorticoid-mediated brain damage are responsible for the persistence of cognitive deficits associated with depression in older age.},

@article{Aziz2015,
abstract = {The past 5 years have seen an increase in the use of a gluten-free diet outside a diagnosis of coeliac disease or IgE-mediated wheat allergy. This trend has led to the identification of a new clinical entity termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). In this Review, we discuss the evidence for NCGS as demonstrated by the results of double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary rechallenge studies. Furthermore, the characteristic phenotype of individuals with NCGS is described as well as the symptom manifestations commonly reported after gluten exposure, which include intestinal symptoms consistent with IBS, and extraintestinal symptoms such as neurological dysfunction, psychological disturbances, fibromyalgia and skin rash. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that NCGS can be associated with organic gastrointestinal pathologies, such as IBD, in which its presence might be a reflection of severe or stricturing disease. However, NCGS is not without its controversies and uncertainties, in particular pertaining to whether it is gluten or nongluten components of the grain evoking symptoms; evidence suggests that fermentable carbohydrates, amylase trypsin inhibitors and wheat-germ agglutinin can also be responsible culprits. Finally, we discuss the novel techniques that might help diagnose NCGS in the future.},

abstract = {One of the most exciting developments in the cognitive sciences in recent years has been a rediscovery of the phenomenology of agency (see e.g. Graham 2004; Horgan et al. 2003; Nahmias et al. 2004). That the phenomenology of agency has received renewed attention is due in no small part to claims that it is at odds with what the cognitive sciences are revealing about the structure of agency itself: in short, that the manifest or phenomenological image of ourselves as agents is inconsistent with the image emerging from the cognitive sciences. Wegner speaks for many when he writes: “{\ldots} it seems to each of us that we have conscious will. It seems we have selves. It seems we have minds. It seems we are agents. It seems we cause what we do. Although it is sobering and ultimately accurate to call all this an illusion, it is a mistake to conclude that the illusion is trivial. On the contrary, the illusions piled atop apparent mental causation are the building blocks of human psychology and social life.”},

The current study uses a mediation model to examine the associations between symptoms of depression, cortisol reactivity and BMI in a cross-sectional study. Methods: Children (N = 111) 8 to 13 years old and a parent completed structured interviews. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess symptoms of depression, and cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children was measured. Physical examinations were used to determine BMI (kg/m2) and pubertal stage. Results: Depression was positively associated with BMI in both sexes. Age and pubertal stage were not significantly associated with BMI, nor was physical activity and BMI in a model including depression. In girls, but not in boys, the association between depression and BMI was mediated by cortisol reactivity. Conclusions: The current findings attest to the significance of psychologic states as potential components in models of childhood obesity, and provide conceptual and empirical support for the inclusion of cortisol reactivity in these models. ?? 2009 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

@article{Kawa2012,
abstract = {The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association, currently in its fourth edition and considered the reference for the characterization and diagnosis of mental disorders, has undergone various developments since its inception in the mid-twentieth century. With the fifth edition of the DSM presently in field trials for release in 2013, there is renewed discussion and debate over the extent of its relative successes - and shortcomings - at iteratively incorporating scientific evidence on the often ambiguous nature and etiology of mental illness. Given the power that the DSM has exerted both within psychiatry and society at large, this essay seeks to analyze variations in content and context of various editions of the DSM, address contributory influences and repercussion of such variations on the evolving landscape of psychiatry as discipline and practice over the past sixty years. Specifically, we document major modifications in the definition, characterization, and classification of mental disorders throughout successive editions of the DSM, in light of shifting trends in the conceptualization of psychopathology within evolving schools of thought in psychiatry, and in the context of progress in behavioral and psychopharmacological therapeutics over time. We touch upon the social, political, and financial environments in which these changes took places, address the significance of these changes with respect to the legitimacy (and legitimization) of what constitutes mental illness and health, and examine the impact and implications of these changes on psychiatric practice, research, and teaching. We argue that problematic issues in psychiatry, arguably reflecting the large-scale adoption of the DSM, may be linked to difficulties in formulating a standardized nosology of psychopathology. In this light, we highlight 1) issues relating to attempts to align the DSM with the medical model, with regard to increasing specificity in the characterization of discrete mental disease entities and the incorporation of neurogenetic, neurochemical and neuroimaging data in its nosological framework; 2) controversies surrounding the medicalization of cognition, emotion, and behavior, and the interpretation of subjective variables as 'normal' or 'abnormal' in the context of society and culture; and 3) what constitutes treatment, enablement, or enhancement - and what metrics, guidelines, and policies may need to be established to clarify such criteria.},

It discusses in more detail one area, namely moral enhancement, which is generating significant contemporary interest. The author argues that so far from being susceptible to new forms of high tech manipulation, either genetic, chemical, surgical or neurological, the only reliable methods of moral enhancement, either now or for the foreseeable future, are either those that have been in human and animal use for millennia, namely socialization, education and parental supervision or those high tech methods that are general in their application. By that is meant those forms of cognitive enhancement that operate across a wide range of cognitive abilities and do not target specifically 'ethical' capacities. The paper analyses the work of some of the leading contemporary advocates of moral enhancement and finds that in so far as they identify moral qualities or moral emotions for enhancement they have little prospect of success.},

abstract = {This contribution deals with developments in the history of philosophy, logic, and mathematics during the time before and up to the beginning of fuzzy logic. Even though the term "fuzzy" was introduced by Lotfi A. Zadeh in 1964/1965, it should be noted that older concepts of "vagueness" and "haziness" had previously been discussed in philosophy, logic, mathematics, applied sciences, and medicine. This paper delineates some specific paths through the history of the use of these "loose concepts". Vagueness was avidly discussed in the fields of logic and philosophy during the first decades of the 20th century-particularly in Vienna, at Cambridge and in Warsaw and Lvov. An interesting sequel to these developments can be seen in the work of the Polish physician and medical philosopher Ludwik Fleck. Haziness and fuzziness were concepts of interest in mathematics and engineering during the second half of the 1900s. The logico-philosophical history presented here covers the work of Bertrand Russell, Max Black, and others. The mathematical-technical history deals with the theories founded by Karl Menger and Lotfi Zadeh. Menger's concepts of probabilistic metrics, hazy sets (ensembles flous) and micro-geometry as well as Zadeh's theory of fuzzy sets paved the way for the establishment of soft computing methods using vague concepts that connote the nonexistence of sharp boundaries. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We have found this method to be useful for preliminary analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data, capable of quickly producing voxel-wise parametric maps describing the heterogeneity of contrast agent kinetics over the entire field of view, typically comprising tens of thousands of voxels. The statistical programming language R is well suited for this type of analysis and when combined with LATEX, via Sweave, allows one to perform all calculations and generate a report with a single script. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the R package DATforDCEMRI, a Deconvolution Analysis Tool for DCE-MRI contrast agent concentration vs. time data, which allows the user to perform kinetic deconvolution analysis and visualize/explore the resulting voxel-wise parametric maps and associated data.},

@article{Takahata2012,
abstract = {Sense of agency refers to the feeling that one's voluntary actions caused external events. Past studies have shown that compression of the subjective temporal interval between actions and external events, called intentional binding, is closely linked to the experience of agency. Current theories postulate that the experience of agency is constructed via predictive and postdictive pathways. One remaining problem is the source of human causality bias; people often make misjudgments on the causality of voluntary actions and external events depending on their rewarding or punishing outcomes. Although human causality bias implies that sense of agency can be modified by post-action information, convincing empirical findings for this issue are lacking. Here, we hypothesized that sense of agency would be modified by affective valences of action outcomes. To examine this issue, we investigated how rewarding and punishing outcomes following voluntary action modulate behavioral measures of agency using intentional binding paradigm and classical conditioning procedures. In the acquisition phase, auditory stimuli were paired with positive, neutral or negative monetary outcomes. Tone-reward associations were evaluated using reaction times and preference ratings. In the experimental session, participants performed a variant of intentional binding task, where participants made timing judgments for onsets of actions and sensory outcomes while playing simple slot games. Our results showed that temporal binding was modified by affective valences of action outcomes. Specifically, intentional binding was attenuated when negative outcome occurred, consistent with self-serving bias. Our study not only provides evidence for postdictive modification of agency, but also proposes a possible mechanism of human causality bias.},

abstract = {The proposed model holds that, at its most fundamental level, visual awareness is quantized. That is to say that visual awareness arises as individual bits of awareness through the action of neural circuits with hundreds to thousands of neurons in at least the human striate cortex. Circuits with specific topologies will reproducibly result in visual awareness that correspond to basic aspects of vision like color, motion, and depth. These quanta of awareness (qualia) are produced by the feedforward sweep that occurs through the geniculocortical pathway but are not integrated into a conscious experience until recurrent processing from centers like V4 or V5 select the appropriate qualia being produced in V1 to create a percept. The model proposed here has the potential to shift the focus of the search for visual awareness to the level of microcircuits and these likely exist across the kingdom Animalia. Thus establishing qualia as the fundamental nature of visual awareness will not only provide a deeper understanding of awareness, but also allow for a more quantitative understanding of the evolution of visual awareness throughout the animal kingdom.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a modified version of the Duke Somatic Algorithm Treatment for Geriatric Depression (STAGED) in a Brazilian sample of older patients with major depression. Besides, we aimed to investigate possible baseline predictive factors for remission in this sample. METHODS: Sixty-seven depressed individuals were treated according to STAGED over 24 weeks in a prospective cohort design with follow-up. All patients had criteria for major depression and were at least 60 years of age at baseline enrollment. RESULTS: During this follow-up, 56 patients could be classified in remitted or not remitted group, 42.85{\%} reached remission, and 57.14{\%} did not reach remission. These results are even better than those found in the original study, probably due to the lower baseline depression severity of our sample. When baseline characteristics were compared between remitted and not remitted groups, scores of Mini Mental State Examination and Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) were the only variables with statistical significant difference (p {\textless} 0.05) between groups. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to try to predict remission and statistical significance (p {\textless} 0.05) was found only for baseline MMSE scores. It may mean that patients with mixed cognitive disorders and mood disorders have a worse course of depression. CONCLUSIONS: This version of STAGED seems to be a useful strategy for treatment of depression in late life. Baseline general cognitive performance might be useful to predict remission of depression in older patients with mild to moderate depression. Further research with different population characteristics should be conducted in order to evaluate its usefulness and feasibility in different settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies describe differences between recommendations for hypertension treatment and actual drug use. Antihypertensive use data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for 1995 to 1999 showed a downward trend for calcium antagonist (CA) use and increased use of beta-blockers (BB) and thiazide diuretics (TD). This study evaluates national VA antihypertensive treatment for 2000 to 2002 and compares these data to treatment data for 1995 to 1999. METHODS: National VA pharmacy data were used to determine use of BB, TD, CA, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and combinations of antihypertensive drugs for 2000 to 2002. Dispensing data were converted to treatment days. In addition to national trends, data were analyzed regionally to examine geographic differences. Pharmacoeconomic analysis estimated the financial impact of medication changes. RESULTS: Antihypertensive drug use in the VA represented more than 1 billion days in 2002. The ACEI were most commonly used, representing 33.4{\{}{\%}{\}} and 33.5{\{}{\%}{\}} of treatment days in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Changes from 2000 to 2002 were 21.9{\{}{\%}{\}} to 24.2{\{}{\%}{\}} for BB, 29.3{\{}{\%}{\}} to 24.4{\{}{\%}{\}} for CA, and 13.2{\{}{\%}{\}} to 14.2{\{}{\%}{\}} for TD. Use of ARB increased from 2.1{\{}{\%}{\}} to 3.7{\{}{\%}{\}} of treatment days. Analysis of the 21 VA regions showed geographic variation. For example, the proportion of BB treatment days is highest in a northeast VA region (28.6{\{}{\%}{\}}) and lowest in a southeast region (19.9{\{}{\%}{\}}). In 2002 the VA has saved an estimated US 8.5 million dollars because of changes in medication use. CONCLUSIONS: As a proportion of antihypertensive agent use, CA continues to fall in the VA, whereas BB, TD, and ARB use have increased. However, TD use remains low, despite national guidelines that promote use of this class of agent.},

abstract = {Our research group has for several years conducted philosophically informed, phenomenological-empirical studies of morbid alterations of conscious experience (subjectivity) in schizophrenia (Sz) and its spectrum of disorders. Some of these experiential alterations constitute, in our view, the vulnerability markers to Sz--indicators that are intrinsic to this disorder and which were historically considered as constituting the phenotypic anchor of the very concept and the diagnostic validity of Sz spectrum disorders. In a more pragmatic clinical context, these indicators, considered here as symptoms, may be potentially effective for early differential diagnosis. In this study, 151 consecutive first-admitted patients (with bipolar, melancholic and organic patients excluded) diagnosed according to the ICD-10, were evaluated on a number of expressive and experiential psychopathological dimensions, with special emphasis on the experiences of perplexity, disorders of self-awareness, perceptual disorders and anomalous bodily experiences. The a priori scales derived from the item pool of a slightly modified OPCRIT and BSABS were used for analyses. Sz and schizotypal disorder scored equally on the subjective dimensions, suggesting a basic phenomenological affinity of these disorders. In contrast, anomalies of subjective experience were clearly more pronounced among the patients within, as compared to those outside the Sz spectrum.},

abstract = {Substantial advances have been made in recent years in the understanding of the genetic basis of behavior in "simpler" organisms, especially the mouse and the fruit fly Drosophila. The authors examine the degree of similarity between the genetic underpinnings of psychiatric illness and genetic influences on behavior in such simpler organisms. Six topics are reviewed: 1) the extent of natural genetic variation, 2) the multigenic nature of natural variation, 3) the impact of individual genes on multiple traits, 4) gene-environment interactions, 5) genetic effects on the environment, and 6) gene-by-sex interactions. The results suggest that the pattern of results emerging in psychiatric genetics is generally consistent with the findings of behavioral genetics in simpler organisms. Across the animal kingdom, individual differences in behavior are nearly always influenced by genetic factors which, in turn, result from a substantial number of individual genes, each with a small effect. Nearly all genes that affect behavior influence multiple phenotypes. The impact of individual genes can be substantially modified by other genes and/or by environmental experiences. Many animals alter their environment, and the nature of that alteration is influenced by genes. For some behaviors, the pathway from genes to behavior differs meaningfully in males and females. With respect to the broad patterns of genetic influences on behavior, Homo sapiens appears to be typical of other animal species.},

abstract = {Background: Studies conducted in high-income countries have reported significant cognitive deficits in first on set schizophrenia subjects relative to asymptotic controls, and it has been suggested that the severity of such deficits could be directly related to the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). It is relevant to conduct similar studies in developing countries, given the supposedly better outcome for schizophrenia patients living in the latter environments. Methods: We applied verbal fluency and digit span tests to an epidemiological-based series of patients with first-onset psychoses (n = 179) recruited in the city of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, and compared the findings with those from non-psychotic control subjects randomly selected from the same geographical areas (n = 383). Results: Psychosis subjects showed lower scores on the three tests relative to controls, with greatest between-group differences for the backward digit span task (p {\textless} 0.0001). There were no significant differences between subjects with affective and schizophreniform psychosis. Cognitive performance indices were negatively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms, but showed no relation to DUP. Conclusion: We found significant cognitive deficits in patients investigated early during the course of psychotic disorders in an environment that is distinct from those where the subjects investigated in previous studies have been drawn from. We found no support to the hypothesis of an association between greater cognitive deficits and a longer DUP. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

In 1980, DSM-III represented a massive "turning of the page" in nosology, and it had the effect of steering psychoanalysis toward the exit in psychiatry and the beginning of a reconciliation of psychiatry with the rest of medicine. With the advent of DSM-5, however, questions are starting to be asked about whether this massive venture is on the right track.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nAbstract available from the publisher.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nAbstract available from the publisher.},

Recently, the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) showed that two-thirds of bipolar-depressed patients had concomitant manic symptoms, these characteristics being linked to a more severe form of bipolar disorder.

As dimensional approach can better describe phenomena that are distributed continuously without clear boundaries, we used the MATHYS scale, constructed on a dimensional approach.

annote = {Mood state heterogeneity in bipolar disorders has led to confusion in diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.


Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) has shown that two-thirds of bipolar-depressed patients had concomitantmanic symptoms (Goldberg et al., 2009). In the STEP-BD study, patients with mixed features had more severe characteristics, such as illness onset at an early age, more bipolar I subtype, more rapid cycling in the past year, and a more frequent history of suicide attempts.




Frye et al. (Frye et al., 2009) showed that minimal manic symptoms at baseline coexisting with an otherwise full syndromal form of bipolar depression are associated with antidepressant treatment-emergentmania or hypomania.


Kraemer et al. (2004) have defined a dimensional approach, in which clinical presentations are classified based on quantitative attributes rather than the assignment to categories. It should work best if describing phenomena that are distributed continuously without clear boundaries. Thus, a dimensional approach appears to be appropriate for defining the spectrum of mixed episodes.


[MATHYS] The concept behind this scale involved exploring all bipolar mood states on a continuum using a score for inhibition/activation and exploring emotional reactivity rather than tonality of affect (euphoria/sadness).


Current classifications partly neglect emotional reactivity. Anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, is a characteristic of melancholia in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 1994). However, in its most complete form, emotional hypo-reactivity can also affect negative stimulation, resulting in an inability for the subject to react to any stimulation. By contrast, emotional reactivity is mentioned in DSM-IV as a feature of atypical depression, but only in response to pleasant stimulation. One must consider that high emotional reactivity should also be factored into negative situations, leading to excessive or inappropriate irritability, anger, sadness or despair. Thus, emotional hyper-reactivity can have different tonalities of affect: euphoria in manic episodes, high lability in mixed states and more negative affects during agitated depression.


Distinguishingthe various sub-forms of depression is highly important in clinical practice. Choosing the most appropriate treatment for each form of depression is not easy and recent guidelines regarding the treatment of bipolar depression are not very helpful. Actually, they recommend on the same line all kinds of treatment including mood stabilizers, atypical anti-psychotics and antidepressant (Malhi et al.,2009;Yathamet al., 2009). The choice of whether to use an antidepressant or an atypical antipsychotic in bipolar depression would be facilitated by distinguishing inhibited/emotional hyporeactive depressson from activated/emotional hyper reactive depression.},

abstract = {This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action-constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution-that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.},

abstract = {A significant number of burns and deaths from fire are intentionally wrought. Rates of intentional burns are unevenly distributed throughout the world; India has a particularly high rate in young women whereas in Europe rates are higher in men in mid-life. Data from hospitalized burn patients worldwide reveal incidence rates for assault by fire and scalds ranging from 3{\%} to 10{\%}. The average proportion of the body surface area burned in an assault by fire or scalds is approximately 20{\%}. In different parts of the world, attempted burning of others or oneself can be attributed to different motives. Circumstances under which assaults occur fall largely into the categories of interpersonal conflict, including spousal abuse, elder abuse, or interactions over contentious business transactions. Contributing social factors to assaults by burning include drug and alcohol abuse, non-constructive use of leisure time, non-participation in religious and community activities, unstable relationships, and extramarital affairs. Although the incidence of self-mutilation and suicide attempts by burning are relatively low, deliberate self-harm carries a significant risk of death, with an overall mortality rate of 65{\%} worldwide. In those who resort to self-immolation, circumstantial themes reflect domestic discord, family dysfunction, and the social ramifications of unemployment. Preventing injurious burn-related violence requires a multifaceted approach, including legislation and enforcement, education, and advocacy. Better standardized assessment tools are needed to screen for risks of abuse and for psychiatric disorders in perpetrators.},

abstract = {There is a well-established link between dysphoric mood and endocrine dysregulation, but the strength of this association may vary with age. In order to investigate this possibility we assessed anxiety and depression with overnight urinary cortisol and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) in 608 factory employees ranging between 21 and 62 years. As expected, DHEAS declined with age (r=-0.54, P{\textless}0.001) while there was a modest age-related increase in nocturnal cortisol (r=0.17, P{\textless}0.001). Depressive symptoms were associated with higher nocturnal cortisol ($\beta$=0.19, P{\textless}0.001), independent of age. While the association between anxiety and cortisol (age by anxiety interaction: $\beta$=0.11, P{\textless}0.05) became stronger with age, there was a similar decline in the DHEAS/cortisol ratio in high-anxious middle-aged adults ($\beta$=-0.10, P=0.018). The current findings suggest that dysphoric mood, and in particular anxiety, may exacerbate the effects of aging on cortisol release. Prospective studies are needed to determine the causal relations between dysphoric mood, cortisol and DHEAS across the lifespan.},

Overall, we need to focus greater attention on the early course of schizophrenia, including defining and describing early course, detecting cases early at onset or in the prodrome, testing whether early detection and treatment enhances treatment response and prognosis, and predicting at-risk cases early in the prodromal phase. Designs to address these questions are presented, and relevant issues are discussed, including study aims and hypotheses, definitions and measures of early phases and caseness, detection (and early detection), treatment interventions, dependent and independent variables, and ethical issues.

abstract = {Investigating the neurobiological basis of schizophrenia is a critical step toward establishing its diagnostic validity, predicting outcome, delineating causative mechanisms and identifying objective targets for treatment research. Over the past two decades, there have been several advances in this field, principally related to developments in neuroimaging, electrophysiological and neuropathological approaches. Several neurobiological alterations in domains of brain structure, physiology and neurochemistry have been documented that may reflect diverse pathophysiological pathways from the "genome to the phenome". While none of the observed abnormalities are likely to qualify as diagnostic markers at this time, many can serve as potential intermediate phenotypes for elucidating etiological factors including susceptibility genes, and as therapeutic targets for novel drug discovery. Despite several challenges including the substantial phenotypic, pathophysiologic and etiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia, technological limitations, and the less than ideal animal models, considerable progress has been made in characterizing the neurobiological substrate of schizophrenia. The accumulating fact-base on the neurobiology of schizophrenia calls for novel integrative model(s) that may generate new, testable predictions.},

abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

One of them is a possible diagnosis inflation that would generate an epidemic of false positive cases. The case of the proposed Attenuated Psychotic Syndrome is an important example, but others like the Mild Neurocognitive Disorder or the Binge Eating Disorder add to the list of controversial new proposals. Moreover, some methodological aspects of the whole procedure, including the imposition of a nondisclosure agreement, the lack of transparency and possible conflicts of interests have also been condemned. Historical developments of the DSMs evolution are reviewed: DSM-III and its diagnostic reliability revolution, DSM-IVs validity problems and the doubts raised by DSM-Vs expected dimensional paradigm shift. Finally, the prospect of neuroscience research as a possible way to overcome the present nosological problems is analyzed.},

abstract = {Scientists have traditionally assumed that different kinds of mental states (e.g., fear, disgust, love, memory, planning, concentration, etc.) correspond to different psychological faculties that have domain-specific correlates in the brain. Yet, growing evidence points to the constructionist hypothesis that mental states emerge from the combination of domain-general psychological processes that map to large-scale distributed brain networks. In this paper, we report a novel study testing a constructionist model of the mind in which participants generated three kinds of mental states (emotions, body feelings, or thoughts) while we measured activity within large-scale distributed brain networks using fMRI. We examined the similarity and differences in the pattern of network activity across these three classes of mental states. Consistent with a constructionist hypothesis, a combination of large-scale distributed networks contributed to emotions, thoughts, and body feelings, although these mental states differed in the relative contribution of those networks. Implications for a constructionist functional architecture of diverse mental states are discussed.},

It is found that normal 3- to 4-year-olds already know that the brain has a set of mental functions, such as dreaming, wanting, thinking, and keeping secrets. In contrast, children with autism appear to know about the physical functions, but typically fail to mention any mental function of the brain. Children with autism, when studied under experimental conditions, have been shown to have difficulties both in the production of deception and in understanding when someone else is deceiving them. People with autism-spectrum conditions are clearly having mentalizing difficulties for reasons different from those seen in people with learning difficulties or those who are blind or deaf, since a deficit can be revealed even in the highest functioning individuals with an autism-spectrum condition in whom general comprehension problems can be ruled out.},

abstract = {Objective: This paper sought to review current knowledge about the relation-ship between substance misuse and early psychosis. Methods: A literature search was conducted using Medline and restricting the search to articles after 1996. Additional articles were sourced from reference lists of relevant articles. Results: There is a high prevalence of substance misuse among persons with early psychosis, with cannabis and alcohol featuring prominently. Substance misuse is associated with earlier onset and possibly more positive symptoms, although apparently not with greater cognitive impairment. Cannabis appears to confer an increased likelihood of developing schizophrenia in biologically vulnerable individuals. Amphetamines also cause psychosis which may become chronic, although specific vulnerability to this effect is less well established. Many cases of so-called 'drug-induced psychosis' become diagnosed as schizophrenia in later years. Specific intervention programs report positive outcomes with regard to substance misuse and the course of psychosis. Conclusions: Substance misuse should always be assessed in this patient group, bearing in mind the potential interactive causes of psychopathology. Intervention is of value in improving outcomes.},

However, up to 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of patients in specialized eating disorder centers do not meet the full diagnostic criteria and are relegated to the residual diagnosis "eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS)". Eating disorders are more varied and variable than the ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria suggest. This article describes the suggested modifications of the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders for the DSM-5. The DSM-5 abstains from setting a specific numerical standard for weight for AN and reduces the required minimum frequency for BN and binge eating disorder (BED) to once a week over the last 3 months. This will likely reduce the number of cases in the EDNOS category. In addition, the DSM-5 provides brief descriptions of several conditions of potential clinical significance without providing detailed criteria in order to stimulate additional research.},

abstract = {First impressions, especially of emotional faces, may critically impact later evaluation of social interactions. Activity in limbic regions, including the amygdala and ventral striatum, has previously been shown to correlate with identification of emotional content in faces; however, little work has been done describing how these signals may influence emotional face memory. We report an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 21 healthy adults where subjects attempted to recognize a neutral face that was previously viewed with a threatening (angry or fearful) or nonthreatening (happy or sad) affect. In a hypothesis-driven region of interest analysis, we found that neutral faces previously presented with a threatening affect recruited the left amygdala. In contrast, faces previously presented with a nonthreatening affect activated the left ventral striatum. A whole-brain analysis revealed increased response in the right orbitofrontal cortex to faces previously seen with threatening affect. These effects of prior emotion were independent of task performance, with differences being seen in the amygdala and ventral striatum even if only incorrect trials were considered. The results indicate that a network of frontolimbic regions may provide emotional bias signals during facial recognition.},

@article{Keshavan2011,
abstract = {The current construct of schizophrenia as a unitary disease is far from satisfactory, and is in need of reconceptualization. The first five papers in our "facts" series reviewed what is known about schizophrenia to date, and a limited number of key facts appear to stand out. Schizophrenia is characterized by persistent cognitive deficits, positive and negative symptoms typically beginning in youth, substantive heritability, and brain structural, functional and neurochemical alterations including dopaminergic dysregulation. Several pathophysiological models have been proposed with differing interpretations of the illness, like the fabled six blind Indian men groping different parts of an elephant coming up with different conclusions. However, accumulating knowledge is integrating the several extant models of schizophrenia etiopathogenesis into unifying constructs; we discuss an example, involving a neurodevelopmental imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neural systems leading to impaired neural plasticity. This imbalance, which may be proximal to clinical manifestations, could result from a variety of genetic, epigenetic and environmental causes, as well as pathophysiological processes such as inflammation and oxidative stress. Such efforts to "connect the dots" (and visualizing the elephant) are still limited by the substantial clinical, pathological, and etiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia and its blurred boundaries with several other psychiatric disorders leading to a "fuzzy cluster" of overlapping syndromes, thereby reducing the content, discriminant and predictive validity of a unitary construct of this illness. The way ahead involves several key directions: a) choosing valid phenotype definitions increasingly derived from translational neuroscience; b) addressing clinical heterogeneity by a cross-diagnostic dimensional and a staging approach to psychopathology; c) addressing pathophysiological heterogeneity by elucidating independent families of "extended" intermediate phenotypes and pathophysiological processes (e.g. altered excitatory/inhibitory, salience or executive circuitries, oxidative stress systems) that traverse structural, functional, neurochemical and molecular domains; d) resolving etiologic heterogeneity by mapping genomic and environmental factors and their interactions to syndromal and specific pathophysiological signatures; e) separating causal factors from consequences and compensatory phenomena; and f) formulating or reformulating hypotheses that can be refuted/tested, perhaps in the mouse or other experimental models. These steps will likely lead to the current entity of schizophrenia being usefully deconstructed and reconfigured into phenotypically overlapping, but etiopathologically unique and empirically testable component entities (similar to mental retardation, epilepsy or cancer syndromes). The mouse may be the way to rescue the trapped elephant!},

The simplest alternative is based on the Bentler-Weeks model, whose basic concepts are reviewed. Selected additional SEM topics are discussed, including some recent developments and their practical implications. New simulation results on model fit under null and alternative hypotheses are also presented that are consistent with statistical theory but in part seem to contradict those reported by Iacobucci.},

My response is aimed at defending a modest doxastic account of clinical delusions, and is articulated in three sections. First, I consider the view that delusions are in-between perceptual and doxastic states, defended by Jacob Hohwy and Vivek Rajan, and the view that delusions are failed attempts at believing or not-quite-beliefs, proposed by Eric Schwitzgebel and Maura Tumulty. Then, I address the relationship between the doxastic account of delusions and the role, nature, and prospects of folk psychology, which is discussed by Dominic Murphy, Keith Frankish, and Maura Tumulty in their contributions. In the final remarks, I turn to the continuity thesis and suggest that, although there are important differences between clinical delusions and non-pathological beliefs, these differences cannot be characterised satisfactorily in epistemic terms.},

abstract = {The most widely used task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses use parametric statistical methods that depend on a variety of assumptions. In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5{\%}, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

abstract = {The Disordered Mind: An Introduction to Philosophy of Mind and Mental Illness, second edition examines and explains, from a philosophical standpoint, what mental disorder is: its reality, causes, consequences, and more. It is also an outstanding introduction to philosophy of mind from the perspective of mental disorder.Revised and updated throughout, this second edition includes new discussions of grief and psychopathy, the problems of the psychophysical basis of disorder, the nature of selfhood, and clarification of the relation between rationality and mental disorder. Each chapter explores a central question or problem about mental disorder, including:what is mental disorder and can it be distinguished from neurological disorder? what roles should reference to psychological, cultural, and social factors play in the medical/scientific understanding of mental disorder? what makes mental disorders undesirable? Are they diseases? mental disorder and the mind–body problem is mental disorder a breakdown of rationality? What is a rational mind? addiction, responsibility and compulsion ethical dilemmas posed by mental disorder, including questions of dignity and self-respect. Each topic is clearly explained and placed in a clinical and philosophical context. Mental disorders discussed include clinical depression, dissociative identity disorder, anxiety, religious delusions, and paranoia. Several non-mental neurological disorders that possess psychological symptoms are also examined, including Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and Tourette's syndrome.Containing chapter summaries and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter, The Disordered Mind, second edition is a superb introduction to the philosophy of mental disorder for students of philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, and related mental health professions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current diagnostic system for subjects at enhanced clinical risk of psychosis allows concurrent comorbid diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders. Their impact on the presenting high-risk psychopathology, functioning, and transition outcomes has not been widely researched. METHODS: In a large sample of subjects with an At-Risk Mental State (ARMS, n = 509), we estimated the prevalence of DSM/SCID anxiety or depressive disorders and their impact on psychopathology, functioning, and psychosis transition. A meta-analytical review of the literature complemented the analysis. RESULTS: About 73{\{}{\%}{\}} of ARMS subjects had a comorbid axis I diagnosis in addition to the "at-risk" signs and symptoms. About 40{\{}{\%}{\}} of ARMS subjects had a comorbid diagnosis of depressive disorder while anxiety disorders were less frequent (8{\{}{\%}{\}}). The meta-analysis conducted in 1683 high-risk subjects confirmed that baseline prevalence of comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders is respectively 41{\{}{\%}{\}} and 15{\{}{\%}{\}}. At a psychopathological level, comorbid diagnoses of anxiety or depression were associated with higher suicidality or self-harm behaviors, disorganized/odd/stigmatizing behavior, and avolition/apathy. Comorbid anxiety and depressive diagnoses were also associated with impaired global functioning but had no effect on risk of transition to frank psychosis. Meta-regression analyses confirmed no effect of baseline anxiety and/or depressive comorbid diagnoses on transition to psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: The ARMS patients are characterized by high prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in addition to their attenuated psychotic symptoms. These symptoms may reflect core emotional dysregulation processes and delusional mood in prodromal psychosis. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are likely to impact the ongoing psychopathology, the global functioning, and the overall longitudinal outcome of these patients.},

abstract = {Ageing is characterized by declines on a variety of cognitive measures. These declines are often attributed to a general, unitary underlying cause, such as a reduction in executive function owing to atrophy of the prefrontal cortex. However, age-related changes are likely multifactorial, and the relationship between neural changes and cognitive measures is not well-understood. Here we address this in a large (N=567), population-based sample drawn from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data. We relate fluid intelligence and multitasking to multiple brain measures, including grey matter in various prefrontal regions and white matter integrity connecting those regions. We show that multitasking and fluid intelligence are separable cognitive abilities, with differential sensitivities to age, which are mediated by distinct neural subsystems that show different prediction in older versus younger individuals. These results suggest that prefrontal ageing is a manifold process demanding multifaceted models of neurocognitive ageing.},

abstract = {Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM - 5) included attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) in Section III under “conditions for further study”. The DSM - 5 task force determined that there was insufficient evidence to warrant inclusion of APS as official mental disorder diagnosis in Section II. “The proposed criteria (APS) are not intended for clinical use; only the criteria sets and disorders in Section II of DSM - 5 are officially recognized and can be used for clinical purposed.”[1] In a study by Tsuang et al.[2] explains the position as “despite advances in the treatment of schizophrenia over the past half-century, the illness is frequently associated with a poor outcome. This is principally related to the late identification and intervention in the course of the illness {\{}{\ldots}{\}} can be difficult to reverse. The emphasis has therefore shifted to defining psychosis-risk syndromes and evaluating treatments that can prevent transition to psychosis in these ultra-high risk groups. To consider the appropriateness of adding psychosis risk syndrome to our diagnostic nomenclature, the psychotic disorders work group extensively reviewed all available data, consulted a range of experts and carefully the variety of expert and public comments on the topic. It was clear that reliable methods were available to define a syndrome characterized by sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (in severity or duration) and which was associated with a very significant increase in the risk of development of a full-fledged psychotic disorder {\{}{\ldots}{\}}within the next year”. Shrivastava et al.[3] reviewed the current status of research{\{}{\ldots}{\}}. arguments for, against and alternatives for inclusion (APS) as a diagnosis and made an attempt to provide a critical synthesis of opinions on this{\{}{\ldots}{\}} APS denotes a kind of temporary culmination of a quarter century of research on early psychosis, the prime goal being to reduce/eliminate duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). DUP is a well-documented and accepted prognostic indicator in Schizophrenia – longer the DUP, worse the outcome - keeping all other factors controlled. For long researchers, especially McGory and his group have been working on identifying and diagnosing psychosis at its earliest presentation, prodromal state and even prior to prodrome “At risk state”, with the hope of bettering the outcome in Schizophrenia. Identification of persons with clinically high risk/ultra high risk/at risk mental state (ARMS) stays as the essential component of primary prevention (akin to diabetes mellitus!!!) in schizophrenia. There has been reasonable progress in this area with identification of patients termed “ARMS”, the risk predominantly meaning progression into schizophrenia. Specific diagnostic symptoms have been enumerated and for better objectivity several scales have been used – comprehensive assessment of at-risk mental states; structured interview for prodromal syndromes/scale of prodromal symptoms, prodromal questionnaire (PQ) 16[4,5] which can be administered with reasonable inter rater reliability to identify patients with ARMS. Of course, there always was a note of caution about high risk of false positives, the stigma and inappropriate interventions! Attempts to identify specific markers for APS in neuroimaging studies have not been successful and there is an overall lack of consistency as to which of these alterations predict the development of psychosis.[6] Literature review regarding intervention benefits has been summed up - benefits for any specific intervention is not conclusive{\{}{\ldots}{\}} it might be possible to delay or prevent transition to psychosis. Although clinical trial findings have been inconsistent, psychosocial approaches {\{}{\ldots}{\}}may reduce the risk of transition to psychosis![7,8] As there was much work going on in some specific centers about the early psychosis, significant changes have occurred in the field of schizophrenia in the last 2-3 decades on a parallel stream.– We have come a long way in the diagnostic process of schizophrenia: From - absence of rapport, wall between patient and the doctor, bizarreness in behavior, pathognomonic significance of the first rank symptoms, pseudo neurotic schizophrenia, simple schizophrenia.{\{}{\ldots}{\}}. To - focus on delusions and hallucinations (qualitatively better definable symptoms), mandatory 6 months duration, less importance to negative symptoms.{\{}{\ldots}{\}}. In my personal opinion, doing away with the subtypes is a major achievement of DSM - 5 and a significant milestone in the conceptualization of schizophrenia, in a definitive positive direction. The proposed diagnostic criteria for APS in DSM - 5: At least one of the following of symptoms is present in attenuated form, with relatively intact reality testing and is of sufficient severity or frequency to warrant clinical attention: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech. Symptom(s) must have been present at least once per week in the last 1 month Symptom(s) must have begun or worsened in the past year Symptom(s) is sufficiently distressing and disabling to the individual to warrant clinical attention Symptom(s) is not better explained by another mental disorder, including: Depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features and is not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition Criteria for any psychotic disorder have never been met. Conceptualization and categorization of APS in DSM - 5 was not a smooth affair as was well argued out in “whither the APS”.[9] The proposed diagnostic criteria, concept and positioning of APS in DSM - 5 created its own share of whys and hows: 1. Attenuated delusion Descriptive psychopathology IS the fundamental professional skill{\{}{\ldots}{\}}.the only diagnostic skill unique to the Psychiatrist{\{}{\ldots}{\}} Delusion is defined as: False belief, unshakeable belief, held with extraordinary conviction, with subjective certainty{\{}{\ldots}{\}}. The decision to call a belief delusional is not made by the person holding the belief, but by an external observer. The description in DSM - 5 of attenuated delusion – “skepticism {\{}{\ldots}{\}}can be elicited with persistent questioning and confrontation” – goes in contrast to the basic definition of Delusion defined in any text book of psychiatry. Skepticism about the “trueness of the belief” makes it no longer a delusion! Same is the case with description of attenuated hallucination – “skepticism about the reality can still be induced{\{}{\ldots}{\}}” 2. You find APS described in DSM - 5 in The Section III (page 783) and also in The Section II (page 122) - APS[10] Among the examples for presentation of “Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” (298.8) for reasons best known to authors!!! 3. “Psychosis risk syndrome” to “APS”: Simon[10] enquired the reason for changing the name wondering whether it serves the purpose of reducing the stigma, which obviously is not so, as stigma is more for the word “psychosis”! in their reply.[11] William Carpenter, Darrel Regier, Rajiv Tandon elaborated that the metamorphosis of “psychosis risk syndrome” to “APS” in DSM - 5 is because “this change instead recognized that a disorder meriting clinical attention was already being manifest and this was explicit in the proposed criteria {\{}{\ldots}{\}} and APS is no more as{\{}{\ldots}{\}} hypercholesterolemia{\{}{\ldots}{\}} but as {\{}{\ldots}{\}}.angina.” APS is thus no more at risk syndrome but a clinical entity demanding attention-makes sense to understand APS as early/mild psychosis. Then why is it not in Section II? “Concern has been that this diagnosis might result in inappropriate treatments,” asserts Darrel Regier, Vice-chairman of the DSM - 5 task force. “Early-intervention ideas are powerful, but very neglected in psychiatry,” “I would hate to see the last 25 years of work on high-risk syndrome thrown out of the window” says Patrick McGorry who worries that the topic might fall by the wayside before the next revision. “Psychotic risk syndrome is valid. Intervening at a pre psychotic stage could ameliorate and even thwart this serious mental illness in a large number of people{\{}{\ldots}{\}} individuals who fit the putative criteria for the psychosis risk syndrome – now officially dubbed APS – are tens to hundreds of times more likely to develop schizophrenia and psychosis than the average person.” says William Carpenter, chairman of the task force on schizophrenia spectrum disorders for DSM - 5. The “whys” and “hows” remain unanswered satisfactorily (answered though) and the debate thus goes on{\{}{\ldots}{\}}. Loud thinking for future research on APS! Include positive family history of psychosis as a criterion Revisit the concept of attenuated delusions, hallucinations{\{}{\ldots}{\}} Long-term (10 years{\{}{\ldots}{\}}) follow-up studies - ? course Antipsychotic treatment – long-term and short term trials Percentage of conversion into schizophrenia over a 10 year period Percentage of conversion into bipolar disorder.

The postulates, so successful at their inception, soon began to show some problems, particularly with cholera, which clearly violated some of Koch's requirements. Subsequent studies of other diseases and the discovery of entirely new ones have so altered and expanded the original postulates that they now are little but a precious touch of history. The present additions and replacements of the original concepts are skillful changes that several authors have devised to introduce new order into understanding complex viral and prion diseases. In 1988, this knowledge, with the totally rational response of the British population and its cattle industry, was critical in promptly blocking the threatened epidemic of human prion disease. In contrast, the recent upsurge of tuberculosis (TB) in the worldwide AIDS epidemic in developing countries, and the sudden increase in metabolic syndrome in wealthy ones, suggests the need for focused sociobiologic research seeking ways to affect the damaging lifestyle behavior of many less educated populations in both settings. The world awaits an equivalent of Koch's Postulates in sociobiology to explain and possibly avert large self-destructive behaviors.},

abstract = {Brain implants, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), which are designed to improve motor, mood and behavioural pathology, present unique challenges to our understanding of identity, agency and free will. This is because these devices can have visible effects on persons' physical and psychological properties yet are essentially undetectable when operating correctly. They can supplement and compensate for one's inherent abilities and faculties when they are compromised by neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, unlike talk therapy or pharmacological treatments, patients need not 'do' anything for the treatment to take effect. If one accepts, as we argue here, that brain implants are unique among implantable types of devices, then this can have significant implications for what it means to persist as the same person and be the source of one's thoughts and actions. By examining two of the most common indications for DBS in current use, namely in the motor (Parkinson's Disease) and psychiatric (Major Depression) domains, we further argue that although DBS, as it is currently applied, does not necessarily represent a unique threat to personal identity and agency per se, it introduces an unprecedented 'third party' into the debate on these concepts. In this way, DBS can be used as a tool to begin probing, both conceptually and empirically, some of philosophy's most perennial metaphysical questions.},

In the case of large expansions beyond 60 repeats onset may result in juvenile HD (JHD, onset before 20 years of age). However, the triplet number does not represent the only onset modifier even in case of large expansions, mechanisms other than the size of the mutation contribute to the phenotype. In this review we discuss the possibility that some of the pathogenic mechanisms contributing to age at onset and progression may differ in the early onset HD compared with the classical adult pathology.},

In total, primary care clinicians write more prescriptions for antidepressants than mental health clinicians and see patients more often in the month before their death by suicide. Treatment of depression by primary care physicians is improving, but opportunities remain in addressing suicide-related treatment variables. Collaborative care models for treating depression have the potential both to improve depression outcomes and decrease suicide risk. Alcohol use disorders and anxiety symptoms are important comorbid conditions to identify and treat. Management of suicide risk includes understanding the difference between risk factors and warning signs, developing a suicide risk assessment, and practically managing suicidal crises.},

Individual {\{}i, j{\}}th elements in the AWM correspond to the association of the SNP in the ith gene to the jth phenotype. While our main objective is to provide a recipe-like tutorial on how to build and use AWM, we also take the opportunity to briefly reason the logic behind each step in the process. To conclude, we discuss the impact on AWM of issues like the number of phenotypes under scrutiny, the density of the SNP chip and the choice of contrast upon which to infer the cause-effect regulatory interactions.},

abstract = {Although cognitive deficits are recognized as a core feature in schizophrenia, their evolution over the course of the illness is still debated. Longitudinal studies of cognition in patients after a first episode of psychosis (FEP) provide extremely useful information, in that they include an adequate and realistic baseline measure of cognitive performance, while at the same time minimizing the effect of confounding variables associated with chronicity. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize findings of studies assessing the longitudinal course of neuropsychological deficits in patients with FEP for durations of at least one year. Overall, the neuropsychological deficits that are present following a first episode of psychosis appeared to remain stable over time for periods of up to ten years, the only possible exception being verbal memory deficits, where there is some evidence of further deterioration over the long term. However, further studies are needed to confirm this conclusion, especially in the (somewhat inconsistently defined) domain of executive function. Improvements in psychopathology appear to positively influence the course of cognitive deficits, although the effects of antipsychotic medication are not as clear. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.},

abstract = {Positive associations between human intelligence and brain size have been suspected for more than 150 years. Nowadays, modern non-invasive measures of in vivo brain volume (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) make it possible to reliably assess associations with IQ. By means of a systematic review of published studies and unpublished results obtained by personal communications with researchers, we identified 88 studies examining effect sizes of 148 healthy and clinical mixed-sex samples ({\textgreater} 8,000 individuals). Our results showed significant positive associations of brain volume and IQ (r = .24, R² = .06) that generalize over age (children vs. adults), IQ domain (full-scale, performance, and verbal IQ), sample type (clinical vs. healthy sample), and sex. Application of a number of methods for detection of publication bias indicates that strong and positive correlation coefficients have been reported frequently in the literature whilst small and non-significant associations appear to have been often omitted from reports. We show that although the positive association of brain volume and IQ seems to be robust, its strength has been overestimated in the literature. While it is tempting to interpret this association in the context of human cognitive evolution and species differences in brain size and cognitive ability, we show that it is not warranted to interpret brain size as a necessary cause or isomorphic proxy of human intelligence differences.},

abstract = {A substantial proportion of patients suffering from schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs) exhibit a general intellectual impairment at illness onset, but the subsequent intellectual course remains unclear. Relationships between accumulated time in psychosis and long-term intellectual functioning are largely uninvestigated, but may identify subgroups with different intellectual trajectories. Eighty-nine first-episode psychosis patients were investigated on IQ at baseline and at 10-years follow-up. Total time in psychosis was defined as two separate variables; Duration of psychosis before start of treatment (i.e. duration of untreated psychosis: DUP), and duration of psychosis after start of treatment (DAT). The sample was divided in three equal groups based on DUP and DAT, respectively. To investigate if diagnosis could separate IQ-trajectories beyond that of psychotic duration, two diagnostic categories were defined: core versus non-core SSDs. No significant change in IQ was found for the total sample. Intellectual course was not related to DUP or stringency of diagnostic category. However, a subgroup with long DAT demonstrated a significant intellectual decline, mainly associated with a weaker performance on test of immediate verbal recall/working memory (WAIS-R Digit Span). This indicates a relationship between accumulated duration of psychosis and long-term intellectual course, irrespective of diagnostic category, in a significant subgroup of patients.},

abstract = {The DSM-5 academic/large clinic field trials were designed to have two phases. Phase 1 was first scheduled to begin in June 2009, but had to be postponed for a year because the criteria sets were not ready. The timetable for field trial completion was unrealistic from the start and not surprisingly the end dates have been repeatedly postponed from early 2010 to early 2011, and were now already into 2012 with no end in sight. Phase 2, originally scheduled for September 2011 to February 2012, was to re-test those diagnoses that did poorly in Phase 1 and had to be revised. The phase 2 trials were quietly canceled. We still dont have results from the phase 1 field trials, but the APA leadership has warned us that we must accept reliabilities that are barely better than chance. Without the second stage, uncorrected problem diagnoses will be included in DSM-5. The separate clinician field trial has been an even worse disaster. Clinicians were originally scheduled to be trained by August 2010, enrolling patients no later than late November 2010, and ending by February, 2011. Training was finally completed 18 months late in December 2011, which means the earliest these trials could possibly end is June 2012well after most DSM-5 final decisions will have been made. Furthermore, of the over 5000 clinicians who registered to participate, only 70 (1.4{\{}{\%}{\}}) have begun enrolling patients for the field trial. My guess is that like academic/large clinic Phase 2 field trial, poor planning and disorganization will force cancellation. Dr Jones concludes, In my opinion, there is no process and not enough time left to ensure that DSM-5 will attain high enough quality to be used by counselors. Fortunately, we can always bypass it by using ICD-10-CM.},

abstract = {Given the growth of prodromal research in the past 15 years, the time seems right for assessing whether the ultra high-risk (UHR) research paradigm has delivered on its promise as an approach to identification of individuals at risk for imminent onset of psychosis and as a platform for studies assessing protective benefits of early interventions and for elucidating predictive markers. As demonstrated by the 8 articles on this theme in the present issue, the empirical basis of the prodromal research area has advanced significantly. While there is a lower risk for transition to psychosis in recent studies compared with initial studies, most recent studies still show a 30{\{}{\%}{\}}-35{\{}{\%}{\}} risk for psychosis within 1-2 years of follow-up, a rate that is substantially higher than the incidence rate of psychosis among transition age youth in the general population. Moreover, the means with which to improve this predictive equation is rapidly developing, enabled by the collaborative integration of data across multiple sites, the employment of multivariate risk algorithms, and a longitudinal perspective on symptoms, cognition, and functioning. All the initial intervention studies have produced encouraging findings, albeit with small sample sizes and relatively large attrition rates. Nevertheless, the findings in this issue, together with others like them appearing at an increasing rate in the world literature, indicate that the prodromal research area is increasing in maturity and sophistication, providing a useful heuristic for early detection and intervention in those at risk for psychosis.},

The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is re- quired to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In face of the multiple controversies surrounding the DSM process in general and the development of DSM-5 in particular, we have organized a discussion around what we consider six essential questions in further work on the DSM. The six questions involve: 1) the nature of a mental disorder; 2) the definition of mental disorder; 3) the issue of whether, in the current state of psychiatric science, DSM-5 should assume a cautious, conservative posture or an assertive, transformative posture; 4) the role of pragmatic considerations in the construction of DSM-5; 5) the issue of utility of the DSM - whether DSM-III and IV have been designed more for clinicians or researchers, and how this conflict should be dealt with in the new manual; and 6) the possibility and advisability, given all the problems with DSM-III and IV, of designing a different diagnostic system. Part 1 of this article took up the first two questions. Part 2 took up the second two questions. Part 3 now deals with Questions 5 {\{}{\&}{\}} 6. Question 5 confronts the issue of utility, whether the manual design of DSM-III and IV favors clinicians or researchers, and what that means for DSM-5. Our final question, Question 6, takes up a concluding issue, whether the acknowledged problems with the earlier DSMs warrants a significant overhaul of DSM-5 and future manuals. As in Parts 1 {\{}{\&}{\}} 2 of this article, the general introduction, as well as the introductions and conclusions for the specific questions, are written by James Phillips, and the responses to commentaries are written by Allen Frances.},

Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was also performed blind to group membership. 26 never-medicated individuals with FEP (23 with DSM-IV schizophrenia) and 38 healthy controls had MRI brain scans. Groups were balanced for age, sex, handedness, ethnicity, paternal socio-economic status, and height. Healthy controls were recruited from the local community by advertisement. Grey matter, white matter, and CSF: global brain volume ratios were significantly smaller in patients. Patients had significantly less grey matter volume in L and R caudate nuclei, cingulate gyri, parahippocampal gyri, superior temporal gyri, cerebellum and R thalamus, prefrontal cortex. They also had significantly less white matter volume in the R anterior limb of the internal capsule fronto-occipital fasciculus and L and R fornices, and significantly greater CSF volume especially in the R lateral ventricle. Excluding the 3 subjects with brief psychotic disorder did not alter our results. Our data suggest that fronto-temporal and subcortical-limbic circuits are morphologically abnormal in never-medicated, schizophrenia. ROI analysis comparing the schizophrenia group (n = 23) with the healthy controls (n = 38) confirmed caudate volumes were significantly smaller bilaterally by 11{\%}, and lateral ventricular volume was significantly larger on the right by 26{\%} in the patients. Caudate nuclei and lateral ventricular volume measurements were uncorrelated (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.30, p = 0.10), ruling out the possibility of segmentation artefact. Ratio of lateral ventricle to caudate volume was bilaterally significantly increased (p {\textless} 0.005, 2-tailed), which could represent an early biomarker in first-episode, never-medicated schizophrenia. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hippocampus plays a crucial role in learning and memory and, in spite of its remarkable plasticity, it is also particularly sensitive to stress hormones due to its high concentration of corticosteroid receptors. Indeed, adrenal steroids modulate hippocampal plasticity, acting on excitability and long term potentiation or depression. By a chronobiological approach, we studied the cortisol and DHEAS secretion in clinically healthy old subjects and in age-matched demented patients, including both the degenerative and the vascular type. When compared to young controls, both clinically healthy elderly subjects and demented patients, particularly those with AD, had significantly higher cortisol levels at night time, i.e. at the moment of the maximal sensitivity of HPA axis to stimulatory or inhibitory inputs. At the same time, a clear age- and disease-dependent reduction of DHEAS secretion was found. Thus the cortisol to DHEAS molar ratio was significantly higher in healthy old subjects, and even more in demented patients, when compared to young controls, and significantly linked to both age and cognitive impairment. Finally, the quantitative and qualitative changes of the adrenal secretory pattern were significantly correlated with the decline of hippocampal volumes, measured by MRI. In conclusion, several lines of evidence deal with a pathogenetic role of stress hormones in the occurrence and progression of cognitive disorders in elderly subjects. The consequent hippocampal neuronal impairment may in turn be responsible for the continuous activation of HPA axis and the increased hypothalamic expression of vasopressin and corticotropin releasing hormone.},

abstract = {Dysfunctional regulation of mood and emotion is a key component of major depressive disorder and leads to sustained negative feelings. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we investigated the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation in patients with major depressive disorder and in healthy controls, testing for acute and sustained neural effects of active emotion regulation. Moderately depressed individuals (n = 17) and never-depressed healthy control subjects (n = 17) underwent fMRI during performance of an active cognitive emotion regulation task while viewing emotionally arousing pictures. In a second task, completed 15 min later, subjects were presented with the same stimuli in a passive viewing task. Whole-brain analyses and connectivity measures were used to determine acute and sustained effects of emotion regulation on brain activation and coupling between regions. On the group level, patients were able to downregulate negative emotions and corresponding amygdala activation, but this ability decreased with increasing symptom severity. Moreover, only healthy control subjects showed a sustained regulation effect in the amygdala after a 15 min delay, whereas depressed patients did not. Finally, patients exhibited diminished prefrontal activation and reduced prefrontolimbic coupling during active regulation. Although emotion regulation capacity in medicated depressive patients appears to be preserved depending on symptom severity, the effect is not sustained. Correlational analyses provide evidence that this diminished sustained-regulation effect might be related to reduced prefrontal activation during regulation.},

abstract = {Efforts to influence medical practice include the formation of expert medical panels who make recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of clinical problems. Despite the considerable expense and effort that go into these activities, it is unclear whether they are successful. Recent studies have evaluated whether recommendations from the Fifth Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V) published in 1993 influenced antihypertensive prescribing patterns. These included a national study of medications dispensed by retail pharmacies and an evaluation of antihypertensive prescribing patterns in US Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. Despite recommendations from JNC V that hydrochlorothiazide and beta-blockers be used as first choice for most hypertensive patients, calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the most common drugs prescribed for hypertension in both 1992 (before JNC V) and 1995 (after JNC V). In retail pharmacies, changes in antihypertensive drug dispensing patterns from 1992 to 1995 reflected increased use of calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors and decreased use of diuretics and beta-blockers, suggesting that JNC V recommendations had little effect on prescribing patterns. Similar patterns of antihypertensive drug use were found in VA facilities. The reasons for the lack of influence of JNC V recommendations on antihypertensive prescribing patterns must be explored and alternative ways of educating health care providers implemented.},

abstract = {The heritability of major depression has been documented in a number of epidemiologic studies. Twin studies have estimated the heritability at about 37{\%} and these estimation can rise up to 70{\%} if severity, relapse rate and age of onset are considered. Despite the relative importance of genetic risk factors in the pathogenesis of this disease, molecular genetic studies, including large genome-wide association studies, only a very small number of candidate genes, explaining little of the variance have been identified. This fact has been termed missing heritability and could be accounted by a number of factors including that the presumed causal variants are not tagged by the current genetic approaches, that major depression is truly polygenic, with each polymorphisms only contributing very small increases in risk, unaccounted environmental influences and complex epigenetic factors. Epigenetics refers to the regulation of DNA transcription without alteration of the original sequence and is controlled by DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs and can be transmitted through generations. A number of clinical and preclinical studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms could play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of major depression. So far, most studies investigated genes within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or the neurotrophin system. It is also of interest that current psychopharmacologic drugs including antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers may exert some of their effects by inducing epigenetic changes. Most notably, epigenetic alterations are potentially reversible and accessibe for drug treatment, which lead to the development of novel classes of antidepressant drugs.},

Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical sur- face, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual interven- tion. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper.

We aimed to compare insight domains (awareness, relabeling, and compliance) in PRS, FES, and MES groups and to correlate scores with psychopathological measures. Insight was assessed in 48 (14 PRS, 16 FES, and 18 MES) patients using the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight-Expanded Version. We conducted psychopathological assessment through the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). In the whole group, the BPRS psychosis factor correlated with all insight domains. In the MES group, the more severe the anxiety/depression, the higher the insight score in the symptom relabeling domain. Insight did not differ significantly between the PRS, FES, and MES groups. Our results suggest that, across different phases of the illness, lack of insight behaves like a trait and is modulated by positive symptom severity. Anxiety and depression may be associated with increased insight in patients with chronic schizophrenia.},

abstract = {In recent years a large body of evidence from several longitudinal studies has emerged suggesting that depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and that the association between depression and increased CVD risk is not merely due to negative mood-driven behavior related with depression. Even though the underlying mechanisms are not well understood, several hypotheses and explanations have been proposed such as increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, abnormalities in the sympathoadrenal system, or abnormalities in platelet function. Platelet function abnormalities, including increased platelet reactivity, may predispose patients with depressive disorders to clotting diatheses and may explain their vulnerability to CVD. Serotonin secreted by platelets induces both platelet aggregation and coronary vasoconstriction. Even though serotonin itself is only a weak platelet agonist, it markedly enhances platelet reactions to a variety of other agonists. Several studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) reduce platelet and whole blood serotonin concentrations after repeated doses, and could therefore exert an inhibitory effect on platelet activation. For that reason, it was hypothesized that SSRIs could have a protective effect against myocardial infarction (MI). Results from three currently available epidemiological studies assessing the risk of MI in patients treated with antidepressants, including SSRIs, are controversial with respect to a potential beneficial effect of SSRIs on CVD risk in depressed patients. However, there is evidence that exposure to SSRIs does not substantially increase the risk of CVD in patients. A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of the SSRI sertraline in patients with major depression and acute MI or unstable angina suggested that sertraline is well tolerated and effective. Further epidemiological studies or longer-term clinical trials may shed more light on this issue, and answer the question conclusively, whether the effect of SSRIs on platelets or another mechanism translates into a decreased risk of CVD in depressed patients.},

METHOD: Across the first six years (1998-2003), users' characteristics are compared between different diagnostic groups and to the local population statistics; and, for an exemplary 12-months period (3-1-2002 to 2-28-2003), the characteristics of telephone contacts with the service are studied. RESULTS: Rising steadily in number across the first three years, 872 persons, predominantly of German citizenship and higher education, consulted the service until 2003, 326 with first-episode psychosis and 144 not fulfilling criteria for a current or beginning psychosis. Of the 402 putatively prodromal patients, 94{\{}{\%}{\}} reported predictive basic symptoms, 68.9{\{}{\%}{\}} attenuated and 20.6{\{}{\%}{\}} transient psychotic symptoms. Most contacts by persons meeting any prodromal criterion were initiated by mental health professionals (psychiatrists or psychologists) and counselling services. CONCLUSION: Supported by public awareness campaigns, an early detection service is well received by its users and private practitioners as reflected by the large proportion of referrals from the latter. However, persons of non-German background as well as of lower education were underrepresented indicating that these sub-groups should be approached by tailored programmes.},

abstract = {A modified dexamethasone suppression test (DST) has had unprecedented evaluation among biologic tests proposed for clinical use in psychiatry. It has not proved to reflect pathophysiologic changes at the level of the central nervous system or pituitary, and tissue availability of dexamethasone itself may contribute to test outcome. The sensitivity of the DST in major depression is limited (about 44{\%} in over 5,000 cases) but is higher in psychotic affective disorders and mixed manic-depressive states (67{\%} to 78{\%}). The high specificity of the DST vs control subjects (over 90{\%}) is not maintained vs other psychiatric disorders (77{\%} specificity overall), and acute "distress" may contribute to nonsuppression of cortisol. The test may have power in differentiating severe melancholic depression, mania, or acute psychosis from chronic psychosis (87{\%} specificity) or dysthymia (77{\%} specificity). The DST status adds about 11{\%} to the prediction of short-term antidepressant response. Suggestions that failure to maintain normal suppression of cortisol predicts poor outcome are not secure. Uncritical enthusiasm or excessive skepticism regarding the DST are unwarranted.},

It is apparent that adolescents with unusual bodily perceptions may conceptually qualify for more than one diagnostic group along the spectrum. To determine whether cenesthopathies in adolescence mirror emerging psychosis, a number of issues need to be considered, i.e. age and mode of onset, gender, level of functioning and drug use. The role of overvalued ideas at the border between hypochondriasis and psychosis must be considered.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: As unusual bodily symptoms may in some instances meet formal psychosis risk criteria, a narrow understanding of these symptoms may lead to both inappropriate application of the new DSM-5 attenuated psychosis syndrome and of treatment selection. On the other hand, the possibility of a psychotic dimension of unusual bodily symptoms in adolescents must always be considered as most severe expression of the cenesthopathy spectrum.},

abstract = {This article discusses the relationship between disease-advocacy groups and the revision process for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. We discuss three examples in which patient-advocacy groups engaged with the DSM-5 revision process: Autism Speaks' worries about the contraction of the autism diagnostic category, the National Alliance on Mental Illness's support for the inclusion of psychosis risk syndrome, and B4U-ACT's critique of the expansion of pedophilia. After a descriptive examination of the cases, we address two prescriptive questions. First, what is the ethical basis for patient and advocate influence on DSM diagnoses? Second, how should the American Psychiatric Association proceed when this influence comes into conflict with other goals of the revision process? We argue that the social effects of, and values embedded in, psychiatric classification, combined with patient and advocates' experiential knowledge about those aspects of diagnosis, ethically justify advocate influence in relation to those particular matters. However, this advocate influence ought to have limits, which we briefly explore. Our discussion has implications for discussions of disease categories as loci for social movements, for analyses of the expanding range of processes and institutions that advocacy groups target, and for broader questions regarding the aims of the DSM revision process.},

abstract = {Evidence of genetic association between the NRG1 (Neuregulin-1) gene and schizophrenia is now well-documented. Furthermore, several recent reports suggest association between schizophrenia and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ERBB4, one of the receptors for Neuregulin-1. In this study, we have extended the previously published associations by investigating the involvement of all eight genes from the ERBB and NRG families for association with schizophrenia. Eight genes from the ERBB and NRG families were tested for association to schizophrenia using a collection of 396 cases and 1,342 blood bank controls ascertained from Aberdeen, UK. A total of 365 SNPs were tested. Association testing of both alleles and genotypes was carried out using the fast Fisher's Exact Test (FET). To understand better the nature of the associations, all pairs of SNPs separated by ≥ 0.5 cM with at least nominal evidence of association (P {\textless} 0.10) were tested for evidence of pairwise interaction by logistic regression analysis. 42 out of 365 tested SNPs in the eight genes from the ERBB and NRG gene families were significantly associated with schizophrenia (P {\textless} 0.05). Associated SNPs were located in ERBB4 and NRG1, confirming earlier reports. However, novel associations were also seen in NRG2, NRG3 and EGFR. In pairwise interaction tests, clear evidence of gene-gene interaction was detected for NRG1-NRG2, NRG1-NRG3 and EGFR-NRG2, and suggestive evidence was also seen for ERBB4-NRG1, ERBB4-NRG2, ERBB4-NRG3 and ERBB4-ERBB2. Evidence of intragenic interaction was seen for SNPs in ERBB4. These new findings suggest that observed associations between NRG1 and schizophrenia may be mediated through functional interaction not just with ERBB4, but with other members of the NRG and ERBB families. There is evidence that genetic interaction among these loci may increase susceptibility to schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The development of a new frontier for research and early intervention in psychotic disorders is highly dependent on the construction of synergistic clinical infrastructures. This has catalyzed great progress in the recognition, enhanced treatment, and study of first episode psychosis, and the task is even more challenging when the boundaries are extended to include the earliest clinical phase of illness, the prodromal or prepsychotic phase. This article describes the conceptual and practical building blocks for the construction of service models for intervention in the postonset clinical phase prior to the attainment of current diagnostic thresholds. This is best regarded as indicated prevention, a form of very early secondary prevention, which involves a blend of immediate clinical care combined with research-oriented preventive intervention. The experience of the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) Clinic in Melbourne across several stages of growth is described and contrasted with that of several emerging centers in Europe and North America. The progress to date, the lessons learned, and the unresolved challenges and opportunities are detailed. It is concluded that service models can be developed that are acceptable and helpful to young people and their families, and that create a unique environment for the study of the transition to frank psychotic disorder. The ultimate clinical utility and general safety of this approach and the range of effective treatments remain unclear, and will be determined by more extensive research.

Krueger and Nicholas R. Eaton (see record 2010-13810-003). Some researchers had hoped the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) would ask psychiatrists (and the clinical psychologists and researchers who are also tied to the DSM) to leap the gap and embrace a trait-based taxonomy of personality pathology (Widiger {\{}{\&}{\}} Trull, 2007). Krueger and Eaton (pp. 97-118, this issue) take a more pragmatic stance: They hope to coax psychiatrists across by introducing personality dimensions as an adjunct to familiar PD types; they envision that DSM-5 might serve "as a bridge" (p. 110, this issue) to a fully dimensional Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Sixth Edition (DSM-6). We acknowledge the wisdom of this strategy and suggest ways to strengthen it.},

abstract = {Structural brain measures are employed as endophenotypes in the search for schizophrenia susceptibility genes. We analyzed two independent structural imaging datasets with voxel-based morphometry and with source-based morphometry, a multivariate, independent components analysis, to determine the stability and heritability of regional gray matter concentration abnormalities in schizophrenia. The samples comprised 209 and 102 patients with schizophrenia and 208 and 96 healthy volunteers, respectively. The second sample additionally included non-ill siblings of participants with and without schizophrenia. A standard voxel-based analysis showed reproducible regional gray matter deficits in the affected participants compared with unrelated, unaffected controls in both datasets: patients showed significant gray matter concentration deficits in cortical frontal, temporal, and insular lobes. Source-based morphometry (SBM) was applied to the gray matter images of the entire sample to determine the effects of diagnosis on networks of covarying structures. The SBM analysis extracted 24 significant sets of covarying regions (components). Four of these components showed significantly lower gray matter concentrations in patients (p {\textless} .05). We determined the familiality of the observed SBM components based on 66 sibling pairs (25 discordant for schizophrenia). Two components, one including the medial frontal, insular, inferior frontal, and temporal lobes, and the other including the posterior occipital lobe, showed significant familiality (p {\textless} .05). We conclude that structural brain deficits in schizophrenia are replicable, and that SBM can extract unique familial and likely heritable components. SBM provides a useful data reduction technique that can provide measures that may serve as endophenotypes for schizophrenia.},

We develop a simple form for the variance of Cochran's homogeneity statistic Q, leading to interval estimation of tau 2 utilizing an approximating distribution for Q; this enables us to extend the point estimation of DerSimonian and Laird. We also develop asymptotic likelihood methods and compared them with this method. We then use these approximating distributions to give a new method of calculating the weight given to the individual studies' results when estimating the overall mean which takes into account variation in these point estimates of tau 2. Two examples illustrate the methods presented, where we show that the new weighting scheme is between the standard fixed and random effects models in down-weighting the results of large studies and up-weighting those of small studies.},

abstract = {Background Temperament and personality traits have been suggested as endophenotypes for bipolar disorder based on several lines of evidence, including heritability. Previous work suggested an anxious-reactive factor identified across temperament and personality inventories that produced significant group discrimination and could potentially be useful in genetic analyses. We have attempted to further characterize this factor structure in a sample of bipolar patients. Methods A sample of 1195 subjects with bipolar I disorder was evaluated, all with complete data available. Dimension reduction across two inventories identified 18 factors explaining 39{\%} of the variance. Results The two largest factors reflected affective instability and general anxiety/worry, respectively. Subsequent analyses of the clinical features associated with bipolar disorder revealed specificity for the factors in a predictable pattern. Cluster analysis of the factors identified a subgroup defined by a strong lack of general anxiety and low affective instability represented by the first two factors. The remaining subjects could be distinguished into two clusters by the presence of either more positive characteristics, including persistence/drive, spirituality, expressivity, and humor, or more negative characteristics of depression and anxiety. Limitations These analyses involved bipolar I subjects only and must be extended to other bipolar spectrum diagnoses, unaffected relatives, and individuals at risk. Conclusions These results suggest that temperament and personality measures access latent traits associated with important clinical features of bipolar disorder. By translating clinical variables into quantitative traits, we may identify subgroups of bipolar patients with distinct clinical profiles, thereby facilitating both individual treatment strategies and genetic analyses.},

abstract = {Background. There is strong evidence that those with a long-standing psychotic disorder have fewer social contacts and less social support than comparison groups. There is less research on the extent of social contacts and support prior to or at the onset of psychosis. In the light of recent evidence implicating a range of social experiences and contexts at the onset of psychosis, it is relevant to establish whether social networks and support diminished before or at the time of onset and whether the absence of such supports might contribute to risk, either directly or indirectly. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review of this literature to establish what is currently known about the relationship between social networks, support and early psychosis. Methods. We identified all studies investigating social networks and support in first episode psychosis samples and in general population samples with measures of psychotic experiences or schizotype by conducting systematic searches of electronic databases using pre-defined search terms and criteria. Findings were synthesized using non-quantitative approaches. Results. Thirty-eight papers were identified that met inclusion criteria. There was marked methodological heterogeneity, which limits the capacity to draw direct comparisons. Nonetheless, the existing literature suggests social networks (particularly close friends) and support diminished both among first episode samples and among non-clinical samples reporting psychotic experiences or with schizotype traits, compared with varying comparison groups. These differences may be more marked for men and for those from minority ethnic populations. Conclusions. Tentatively, reduced social networks and support appear to pre-date onset of psychotic disorder. However, the substantial methodological heterogeneity among the existing studies makes comparisons difficult and suggests a need for more robust and comparable studies on networks, support and early psychosis.},

Asian Americans bring unique issues to the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. They may exhibit greater prevalence of culturally influenced psychosis-like experiences that may or may not constitute a pathological condition such as psychosis risk syndrome or attenuated psychosis. Acute psychotic disorders with good prognosis may be more prevalent in Asians and may sometimes be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Catatonic disorders are also more prevalent in Asians, and are likely to receive more appropriate labeling with DSM-5. The expanded cultural formulation in DSM-5 is a progressive step but its benefits might be limited by lack of culturally trained clinicians and/or limited time for assessment. There is a dearth of systematic data on psychotic disorders in Asian Americans and it is hoped that the DSM-5 will stimulate this much needed research. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To carry out a systematic review of the literature addressing cognitive functions in first-episode psychosis (FEP), divided into domains. Although this is not a full "cognitive-genetics-in-schizophrenia review," we will also include putative ideas of mechanism(s) behind these impairments, focusing on how early stress, and genetic vulnerability may moderate cognitive function in psychosis.

METHOD: Relevant studies were identified via computer literature searches for research published up to and including January 2013, only case-control studies were included for the neurocognitive meta-analysis.

RESULTS: Patients with FEP present global cognitive impairment compared to healthy controls. The largest effect size was observed for verbal memory (Cohen's d effect size = 2.10), followed by executive function (effect size = 1.86), and general IQ (effect size = 1.71). However, effect sizes varied between studies.

CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment across domains, up to severe level based on Cohen's effect size, is present already in FEP studies. However, differences in levels of impairment are observed between studies, as well as within domains, indicating that further consolidation of cognitive impairment over the course of illness may be present. Cognitive abnormalities may be linked to a neurodevelopmental model including increased sensitivity to the negative effect of stress, as well as genetic vulnerability. More research on this field is needed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present study, we tested both the cumulative stress and the mismatch hypothesis of psychopathology. For this purpose the combined effects of early-life adversity and later-life stress exposure on behavioral markers of psychosis susceptibility were studied in male Wistar rats.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHOD: Experiment I: rat pups divided on the basis of the levels of their maternal care experience in low, medium or high maternal care groups, were reared post-weaning in groups (Exp. IA) or in social isolation (Exp. IB) and tested at adulthood under basal conditions or after an acute corticosterone (CORT) administration. Maternal care levels were assessed by measuring the dam's licking and grooming (LG) the first postnatal week of life. Experiment II: rat pups exposed as neonates to daily sessions of 8h of maternal separation (MS) on postnatal days 3, 4 and 5 either altogether in their home cage (HOME SEP) or alone in a novel environment (NOVEL SEP), were reared post-weaning in groups and tested at adulthood under basal conditions. Adult testing included behaviors marking psychosis susceptibility: apomorphine-induced gnawing (APO-gnawing), acoustic startle response and its modulation by a prepulse stimulus (PPI). The behavior of the Medium LG offspring was used as baseline reference for all the three experiments.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: Experiment I: Low maternal LG history alone had limited effects on the behavior of Wistar offspring, although increased acoustic startle and increased PPI, at high prepulse intensity levels, were observed. When low maternal LG history was combined with post-weaning social isolation, basal APO-gnawing was decreased and PPI increased, compared to High LG and Med LG offspring. This reflects attenuated psychosis susceptibility. High LG offspring reared in isolation displayed, however, the highest APO-gnawing and the lowest PPI levels among rats reared in social isolation, which is indicative for increased psychosis susceptibility. These findings support the mismatch hypothesis. For demonstration of the cumulative stress hypothesis an injection of CORT in the adult Low LG offspring was required that increased APO-gnawing and reduced PPI. This CORT-induced PPI disruption was greatly enhanced after additional isolation rearing. The High LG group, either socially housed or reared in isolation, was resistant to the acute effects of CORT at adulthood. Experiment II: MS increased psychosis susceptibility only in NOVEL SEP rats that had experienced MS in the context of early social isolation. These individuals displayed increased adult APO-gnawing and reduced PPI, if reared post-weaning in a condition that does not match with their early life social environment (i.e. group housing). This finding supports the mismatch hypothesis.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: The outcome of environmental manipulations on developmental programming of psychosis susceptibility depends on the interplay of early-life adversity and later-life stressors in a manner that supports the mismatch hypothesis. However, evidence for the cumulative stress hypothesis arises if vulnerable individuals are exposed in later life additionally to excess of the stress hormone CORT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the extent to which measurement of adult cognitive functioning differs between Spanish and English language administrations of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is critical for inclusive, representative, and valid research of older adults in the United States. OBJECTIVES: We sought to demonstrate the use of an item response theory (IRT) based structural equation model, that is, the MIMIC model (multiple indicators, multiple causes), to evaluate MMSE responses for evidence of differential item functioning (DIF) attributable to language of administration. SUBJECTS: We studied participants in a dementia case registry study (n = 1546), 42{\%} of whom were examined with the Spanish language MMSE. RESULTS: Twelve of 21 items were identified as having significant uniform DIF. The 4 most discrepant included orientation to season, orientation to state, repeat phrase, and follow command. DIF accounted for two-thirds of the observed difference in underlying level of cognitive functioning between Spanish- and English-language administration groups. CONCLUSIONS: Failing to account for measurement differences may lead to spurious inferences regarding language group differences in level of underlying level of cognitive functioning. The MIMIC model can be used to detect and adjust for such measurement differences in substantive research.},

In this study, we performed extensive analyses to test the hypothesis that individual differences in intelligence are associated with brain structural organization, and in particular that higher scores on intelligence tests are related to greater global efficiency of the brain anatomical network. We constructed binary and weighted brain anatomical networks in each of 79 healthy young adults utilizing diffusion tensor tractography and calculated topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. Based on their IQ test scores, all subjects were divided into general and high intelligence groups and significantly higher global efficiencies were found in the networks of the latter group. Moreover, we showed significant correlations between IQ scores and network properties across all subjects while controlling for age and gender. Specifically, higher intelligence scores corresponded to a shorter characteristic path length and a higher global efficiency of the networks, indicating a more efficient parallel information transfer in the brain. The results were consistently observed not only in the binary but also in the weighted networks, which together provide convergent evidence for our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of brain structural organization may be an important biological basis for intelligence.},

There are four reasons to challenge the belief that DSM-I was a psychoanalytic system. First, psychoanalysts were a minority on the committee that created DSM-I. Second, psychoanalysts of the time did not use DSM-I. Third, DSM-I was as infused with Kraepelinian concepts as it was with psychoanalytic concepts. Fourth, contemporary writers who commented on DSM-I did not perceive it as psychoanalytic. The first edition of the DSM arose from a blending of concepts from the Statistical Manual for the Use of Hospitals of Mental Diseases, the military psychiatric classifications developed during World War II, and the International Classification of Diseases (6th edition). As a consensual, clinically oriented classification, DSM-I was popular, leading to 20 printings and international recognition. From the perspective inherent in this paper, the continuities between classifications from the first half of the 20th century and the systems developed in the second half (e.g. DSM-III to DSM-5) become more visible.{\{}{\textless}{\}}/p{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Demonstrating specific cognitive impairments in psychotic disorders is difficult. However, specific deficits in memory and executive functions have often been claimed. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) tasks of IDED attention-shifting (an executive task) and visuospatial paired associates learning (PAL, a memory task) require intact frontal and temporo-hippocampal functioning, respectively; both have been suggested as markers of disease progress in psychosis. METHOD: Seventy-one subjects with a first-episode psychosis or at-risk mental state were assessed on these two tasks during referral to a specialist service, the Cambridge-based CAMEO early intervention team. RESULTS: Performance on the two tasks was dissociated. Poor performance on the PAL test was associated with increased symptom levels and poorer global function, while failure on the IDED executive test was not found to have significant clinical associations. Duration of illness was not associated with performance on either task. CONCLUSIONS: Visuospatial PAL failure may be a marker of clinical severity at the onset of psychosis while IDED performance may reflect a more stable, trait-like impairment. Dissociated performance on the executive and associative learning tasks may reflect independent, neurally dissociated impairments that do not arise in a fixed order. This may explain some of the heterogeneity of cognitive function seen in early psychosis.},

The present study addresses this issue by means of a meta-analysis including eight relevant studies published up to January 2012 that reported remission rates from an initial CHR status. The primary effect size measure was the longitudinal proportion of remissions compared to non-remission in subjects with a baseline CHR state. Random effect models were employed to address the high heterogeneity across studies included. To assess the robustness of the results, we performed sensitivity analyses by sequentially removing each study and rerunning the analysis. Of 773 subjects who met initial CHR criteria, 73{\{}{\%}{\}} did not convert to psychosis along a 2-year follow. Of these, about 46{\{}{\%}{\}} fully remitted from the baseline attenuated psychotic symptoms, as evaluated on the psychometric measures usually employed by prodromal services. The corresponding clinical remission was estimated as high as 35{\{}{\%}{\}} of the baseline CHR sample. The CHR state is associated with a significant proportion of remitting subjects that can be accounted by the effective treatments received, a lead time bias, a dilution effect, a comorbid effect of other psychiatric diagnoses. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The average age at death was 48.4 years. The causes of death were divided into three groups; 'diseases', 'accidents', 'suicide and homicide', accounting for 73.5{\%}, 10.5{\%} and 7.3{\%} of 257 deaths, respectively. Death rates per 1000 persons for the years at risk were compared with the expected rates for the general population. Briefly, the death rates for patients were more than 10 times as large as those in the general population. Our results showed that liver cirrhosis and heart failure ranked high among the causes of death in alcoholics. Among patients who died, only 3.1{\%} were total abstainers after discharge from hospital, which was an extremely low proportion in comparison with the average cross-total abstinence rate of 25.8{\%} among patients after discharge.},

abstract = {In face of the multiple controversies surrounding the DSM process in general and the development of DSM-5 in particular, we have organized a discussion around what we consider six essential questions in further work on the DSM. The six questions involve: 1) the nature of a mental disorder; 2) the definition of mental disorder; 3) the issue of whether, in the current state of psychiatric science, DSM-5 should assume a cautious, conservative posture or an assertive, transformative posture; 4) the role of pragmatic considerations in the construction of DSM-5; 5) the issue of utility of the DSM - whether DSM-III and IV have been designed more for clinicians or researchers, and how this conflict should be dealt with in the new manual; and 6) the possibility and advisability, given all the problems with DSM-III and IV, of designing a different diagnostic system. Part I of this article will take up the first two questions. With the first question, invited commentators express a range of opinion regarding the nature of psychiatric disorders, loosely divided into a realist position that the diagnostic categories represent real diseases that we can accurately name and know with our perceptual abilities, a middle, nominalist position that psychiatric disorders do exist in the real world but that our diagnostic categories are constructs that may or may not accurately represent the disorders out there, and finally a purely constructivist position that the diagnostic categories are simply constructs with no evidence of psychiatric disorders in the real world. The second question again offers a range of opinion as to how we should define a mental or psychiatric disorder, including the possibility that we should not try to formulate a definition. The general introduction, as well as the introductions and conclusions for the specific questions, are written by James Phillips, and the responses to commentaries are written by Allen Frances.},

However, the extent to which different diagnostic types of illness develop remains unclear.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify studies of HRP participants reporting International Classfication of Diseases/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnostic outcomes at follow-up. Demographic, clinical, and methodological variables were extracted from each publication or obtained directly from its authors. A meta-analysis was performed of transition to schizophrenic (SP) or affective psychoses (AP) and to specific diagnostic categories.

Among HRP participants who developed psychosis, 73{\{}{\%}{\}} were diagnosed with SP and only 11{\{}{\%}{\}} with AP (Risk Ratio, RR = 5.43, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI from 3.35 to 8.83).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A recent meta-analysis identified processing speed inefficiency as the largest single cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. However, the effect of potential moderator variables, such as medication status and severity of illness, remained unclear. The authors present an extended meta-analysis of processing speed and other specific cognitive functions in schizophrenia and examine the role of potential moderator variables. METHOD: In addition to the studies identified in the original analysis, subsequently published articles were identified via systematic searches of MEDLINE and PsycINFO for the period from May 2006 to January 2009. The authors extracted data for potential moderator variables, including publication year; severity of illness; chlorpromazine equivalent daily dose; and mean IQ, mean age, and sample size for each study. Effect sizes were calculated for all measures, and meta-influence and homogeneity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Eleven studies were added to the original analysis, increasing the schizophrenia sample size from 1,915 to 4,135. The largest effect size was for coding tasks (g=-1.50), followed by category fluency (g=-1.31). However, for coding tasks, variation in effect size magnitude attributable to heterogeneity was substantial. Metaregression analyses indicated that three moderator variables were related to coding task effect size: publication year, IQ difference from comparison subjects, and chlorpromazine equivalent daily dose. There was a difference of 0.8 effect size units between studies with low compared with high chlorpromazine equivalent daily dose. No significant relationships were found between any moderators and the other cognitive tasks included in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The processing speed impairment in schizophrenia is substantially affected by several moderating factors, in particular antipsychotic medication dosage.},

We examined the cross-cultural evidence on the prevalence, characteristics, and associated features of pseudoneurological symptoms more generally, and conversion disorder in particular, in order to inform the ongoing re-evaluation of the conversion disorder category. We also examined the relationship between these constructs and dissociative symptoms and disorders across cultural groups. Searches were conducted of the mental health literature, particularly since 1994, regarding culture, race, or ethnicity factors related to conversion disorder. Many proposed DSM-5 revisions were supported, such as the elimination of Criterion B. We also found cross-cultural variability in predominant symptoms, disorder prevalence, and relationship with cultural syndromes. Additional information that may contribute to DSM-5 includes the elevated rates across cultures of traumatic exposure and psychiatric comorbidity in conversion disorder. Cross-culturally, conversion disorder is associated strongly with both dissociative and somatoform presentations, revealing no clear basis on which to locate the disorder in DSM-5. Careful consideration should be given to the possible alternatives.},

Psychiatrists continue to grapple with the full ramifications of the condition, even though interest specifically in pathological lying seems to have waned in recent times. The impact of pathological lying deserves critical attention from forensic psychiatrists because of the implications that untruths have in a legal context. In this article, the authors review the considerable vagueness and confusion that has surrounded this concept and examine the extent to which a person can control lying behavior and the related question of whether pathological liars have responsibility for their actions. While providing a structured framework for considering pathological lying in the forensic context, the authors conclude that further systematic research is needed to resolve the questions raised in this article.},

Practitioner reliability studies are required to secure consistency while examining clinical and forensically-relevant facts. Large scale investigations, published in APA journals, may help quiet skeptics and strengthen scientifically-based testimony regarding PA. This book and opposing references should be included in the libraries of professionals working in this forensic psychology area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {Until recently, the dominant view was that schizophrenia patients have limited, if any, neuropsychological impairments, and those that are observed are only secondary to the florid symptoms of the disorder. This view has dramatically changed. This review integrates recent evidence demonstrating the severity and profile of neuropsychological impairments in schizophrenia. We present quantitative evaluation of the literature demonstrating that the most severe impairments are apparent in episodic memory and executive control processes, evident on a background of a generalized cognitive deficit. The neuropsychological impairments potentially represent genetic liability to the disorder, as similar, yet milder, impairments are evident in schizophrenia patients even before the onset of psychotic symptoms, as well as in the nonpsychotic relatives of schizophrenia patients. Corresponding cognitive neuroimaging literature on executive functions, episodic memory, and working memory in schizophrenia documenting abnormalities in frontal and medial temporal lobes is summarized, and current models integrating neuropsychological and neuroimaging data are discussed.},

abstract = {Objectives To examine the prevalence of substance use among treatment na{\"{i}}ve patients with first episode psychosis presenting to a psychiatry outpatient clinic in India. Methods The study sample consisted of 139 first episode treatment na{\"{i}}ve patients with psychosis from in and around Bangalore, a city in South India. Self as well as informant-reported data on type, use and duration of substance use as well as the severity of psychotic symptoms were collected using structured instruments. Urine toxicology screen was also conducted for six common drugs of abuse. Breath alcohol analysis was performed in all patients. Results Acute and transient psychosis was the most common diagnosis (42.4{\%}). Overall, 20{\%} of the population reported current substance use disorder (excluding nicotine). Current alcohol dependence was diagnosed among 17.3{\%}, whereas cannabis dependence in 3.6{\%}. Life time as well as current use of cannabis was less than 6{\%}. While one patient reported inhalant abuse none reported use of amphetamine or opioids. There was very high concordance between reported drug use and urine toxicology screen. Conclusion The use of illicit drugs is substantially less among first episode drug na{\"{i}}ve patients with psychosis in an Indian urban clinical setting compared to rates reported from developed countries like North America, Canada and UK. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This is clearly unattainable, and so energy has now been diverted into developing other major changes, including the development of dimensional ratings and the formal diagnosis of prodromal and subthreshold disorders. It is argued that this process could lead to false positive 'epidemics' with harmful excessive treatments. The better, more modest, alternative is to reassess the text descriptions of the disorders and join with ICD-11 in creating a single nested system for both DSM-V and ICD-11.},

abstract = {Cognitive dysfunction is a hallmark feature of schizophrenia and is evident across all phases of the illness. While prior meta-analyses have elucidated the level and pattern of cognitive deficits in the premorbid and post-onset periods of psychosis, no meta-analyses of studies of the putative prodromal period have been published. Our primary aim is to provide a meta-analysis of neurocognitive findings from 14 studies of psychosis risk syndrome (PRS) individuals published through February 2011, and compare the resulting profile with that synthesized by meta-analyses from other periods of the disorder. Meta-analysis of 1215 PRS individuals with a mean age of 19.2 (± 3.3) and 851 healthy control subjects yielded small-to-medium impairments across nine of 10 neurocognitive domains (Cohen's d = -0.26 to -0.67). Seven studies reported on PRS individuals who later developed psychosis (n = 175) and their baseline performance level generally yielded moderate-to-large ESs (d = -0.35 to -0.84). Mild cognitive deficits are reliably and broadly present in PRS individuals, falling at a level that is intermediate between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with schizophrenia, and at a level that is comparable to those at familial ("genetic") risk and with premorbid data. Moreover, baseline neurocognition in PRS individuals who converted to psychosis showed more severe deficits than non-converters in nearly all domains. However, considerable heterogeneity of ESs across studies in many domains underscores variability in phenotypic expression and/or measurement sensitivity, and a critical need for improved reporting of sample characteristics to support moderator variable analyses.},

abstract = {Personality pathology is currently captured in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual through 10 categorical personality disorder (PD) diagnoses grouped into three descriptive clusters. This classification system has been criticized by many for using discrete categories and arbitrary thresholds when making clinical decisions. To address these critiques, the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group has put forth a proposal that significantly alters the structure and content of the DSM-IV PD section. If this DSM-5 Work Group has conducted its own systematic review of the empirical literature, this review has not been released or made widely available. As such, it is up to the psychology community at large to determine how well the suggested changes align with findings from extant PD research. The current article joins this effort by addressing the contribution of behavior genetic findings to the revision process for classification of PDs in DSM-5. First, we provide a brief review of the history of PD classification in the DSM. Next, we present an overview and rationale for each of the five major suggested changes to PD diagnoses. For each suggested change, we outline the available evidence from behavior genetics and interpretations of these findings. Finally, we offer a summary of considerations for PD classification as the DSM-5 moves forward. Review of the behavior genetics literature suggests that several features of the DSM-5 proposal, including the elimination of 4 PDs, merging clinical disorders and PDs on a single axis, and the implementation of a trait rating system, require significantly greater explication before a product is finalized.

@article{Schwartz2005,
abstract = {Neuropsychological research on the neural basis of behaviour generally posits that brain mechanisms will ultimately suffice to explain all psychologically described phenomena. This assumption stems from the idea that the brain is made up entirely of material particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience can therefore be formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. Thus, terms having intrinsic mentalistic and/or experiential content (e.g. 'feeling', 'knowing' and 'effort') are not included as primary causal factors. This theoretical restriction is motivated primarily by ideas about the natural world that have been known to be fundamentally incorrect for more than three-quarters of a century. Contemporary basic physical theory differs profoundly from classic physics on the important matter of how the consciousness of human agents enters into the structure of empirical phenomena. The new principles contradict the older idea that local mechanical processes alone can account for the structure of all observed empirical data. Contemporary physical theory brings directly and irreducibly into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made by human agents about how they will act. This key development in basic physical theory is applicable to neuroscience, and it provides neuroscientists and psychologists with an alternative conceptual framework for describing neural processes. Indeed, owing to certain structural features of ion channels critical to synaptic function, contemporary physical theory must in principle be used when analysing human brain dynamics. The new framework, unlike its classic-physics-based predecessor, is erected directly upon, and is compatible with, the prevailing principles of physics. It is able to represent more adequately than classic concepts the neuroplastic mechanisms relevant to the growing number of empirical studies of the capacity of directed attention and mental effort to systematically alter brain function.},

Epidemiologists rightly work from a science-based approach to causation in epidemiology, but largely disagree about the matter. Disagreement may be partly due to confusion of the question of useful concepts for causal inference in epidemiological practice with the question of the metaphysical presuppositions of causal concepts used in epidemiology. In other words, epidemiologists seem to confuse the practical results of epidemiological research at the population level with the metaphysical views about the reality of disease causation at the individual level in their writings on causation.},

abstract = {The 'faculty psychology' approach to the mind, which attempts to explain mental function in terms of categories that reflect modular 'faculties', such as emotions, cognitions, and perceptions, has dominated research into the mind and its physical correlates. In this paper, we argue that brain organization does not respect the commonsense categories belonging to the faculty psychology approach. We review recent research from the science of emotion demonstrating that the human brain contains broadly distributed functional networks that can each be re-described as basic psychological operations that interact to produce a range of mental states, including, but not limited to, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and so on. When compared to the faculty psychology approach, this 'constructionist' approach provides an alternative functional architecture to guide the design and interpretation of experiments in cognitive neuroscience.},

abstract = {Impaired sustained attention seems to be a specific neuropsychological deficit that is closely linked to schizophrenia. Voxel based morphometry has emerged as a useful tool for the detection of subtle gray matter (GM) abnormalities. The aim of our study was to identify the cerebral regions related to the Identical-Pair version of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT-IP) performance in schizophrenic patients. The study included 13 right-handed, male, first-episode, paranoic, neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients and 13 matched controls. High-resolution whole-brain MR images were segmented and analyzed for the whole brain and for regions of interest (ROI) using SPM99. Furthermore, the correlation between CPT-IP performance and GM density was examined. Volumetric analysis of the thalami was also carried out. GM density analysis shown decreases in patients in anterior cingulate gyrus, left inferior frontal, right claustrum, left pulvinar, and dorsomedial bilateral thalamic nuclei, and caudate nuclei as well as left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Thalamic ROIs revealed a strong correlation between groups differences. The thalamic GM density allowed a good individual classification. GM increases were detected in left insula, superior temporal gyrus, and putamen nucleus, and right supramarginal gyrus. Schizophrenic patients showed smaller left and right thalamic volumes. We found that GM density of the left thalamic nucleus, left angular, and supramarginal gyrus, and left inferior frontal and postcentral gyri correlated significantly with CPT-IP performance in patients but not in controls. Moreover, the restricted ROIs regression was strongly significant for both left and right thalamus. In summary, we provide evidence for the involvement of thalamic, inferior-parietal, and frontal regions in the attentional deficits observed in schizophrenic patients. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {The "Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome" (APS, sometimes referred to as the "schizophrenia prodrome") is characterized by subthreshold psychotic-like symptoms and functional decline, and is often associated with significant disability. These symptoms may cause impairment and are of further interest due to their predictive relation to schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. These symptoms currently are not represented in the diagnostic system for mental health, and it is unclear how they are conceptualized by relevant professionals. The current study surveyed a national sample (n = 303) of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and general practitioners regarding their clinical appraisal of APS. Practitioners were asked to respond to vignettes representing three conditions: psychosis, subthreshold psychosis (indicating 'attenuated' psychosis symptoms), and no psychotic symptoms. Practitioners' responses suggested that APS is viewed consistently with a DSM-IV-TR defined mental disorder and that most clinicians may diagnose this condition as a full threshold psychotic disorder. Findings tentatively suggest that the inclusion of an attenuated psychosis symptoms category in the forthcoming DSM-5 may be helpful in improving diagnostic reliability and facilitating best practice among community practitioners. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are widely used for the treatment of depression and anxious disorders. The observation that depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with ischemic heart disease, the assessment of the central role of serotonin in pathophysiological mechanisms of depression, and reports of cases of abnormal bleeding associated with antidepressant therapy have led to investigations of the influence of antidepressants on hemostasis markers. In this review, we summarize data regarding modifications of these markers, drawn from clinical studies and case reports. We observed an association between the type of antidepressant drug and the number of abnormal bleeding case reports, with or without modifications of hemostasis markers. Drugs with the highest degree of serotonin reuptake inhibition--fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline--are more frequently associated with abnormal bleeding and modifications of hemostasis markers. The most frequent hemostatic abnormalities are decreased platelet aggregability and activity, and prolongation of bleeding time. Patients with a history of coagulation disorders, especially suspected or documented thrombocytopenia or platelet disorder, should be monitored in case of prescription of any serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI). Platelet dysfunction, coagulation disorder, and von Willebrand disease should be sought in any case of abnormal bleeding occurring during treatment with an SRI. Also, a non-SSRI antidepressant should be favored over an SSRI or an SRI in such a context. Considering the difficulty in performing platelet aggregation tests, which are the most sensitive in SRI-associated bleeding, and the low sensitivity of hemostasis tests when performed in case of uncomplicated bleeding in the general population, establishing guidelines for the assessment of SRI-associated bleeding complications remains a challenge.},

One of the potential benefits of including this diagnosis in DSM-5 is to identify persons at high risk of developing psychotic disorders to prevent the appearance of these disorders or lead to disorders with a better prognosis. One of the challenges applying the criteria proposed to the pediatric population is the difficulty in defining "attenuated" in the same way and it is done with adults. The threshold for psychosis may be lower in children and, therefore, what is attenuated in adults may be fully present, although transient, in paediatric population. Other potential risks are a lower threshold for prescribing antipsychotics without clear evidence and whether the help-seeking behaviour criterion will be applied to the patients and/or the parents.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In schizophrenia research, early detection in the initial prodrome before first psychotic episodes is a major topic. Therefore, the prognostic accuracy of initial prodromal symptoms was examined prospectively. METHODS: The study sample was composed of patients referred to outpatient departments of German psychiatric university departments, because of diagnostic problems, between 1987 and 1991. They were examined with the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms and the Ninth Version of the Present State Examination to detect an incipient schizophrenic disorder. Of 385 patients showing no schizophrenia-characteristic symptoms, between 1995 and 1998, 110 with and 50 without initial prodromal symptoms were followed up and reexamined with the same instruments for a transition to schizophrenia. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 9.6 years, 79 (49.4{\%}) of the 160 patients had transited to schizophrenia. The absence of prodromal symptoms excluded a subsequent schizophrenia with a probability of 96{\%} (sensitivity: 0.98; false-negative predictions: 1.3{\%}), whereas their presence predicted schizophrenia with a probability of 70{\%} (specificity: 0.59; false-positive predictions: 20{\%}). Certain disturbances, such as thought interference, disturbances of receptive language, or visual distortions, predicted schizophrenia, even with a probability up to 91{\%} (specificity: 0.85-0.91; false-positive predictions: 1.9{\%}-7.5{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: The Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms operationalization of prodromal symptoms performed well in the early detection of schizophrenia. It therefore might be useful for the prediction of the disorder, especially if it is further refined to select those items with particularly high prognostic accuracy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The term "mood stabilizer" is widely used in the context of treating bipolar disorder, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not officially recognize the term, and no consensus definition is accepted among investigators. The authors propose a "two-by-two" definition by which an agent is considered a mood stabilizer if it has efficacy in treating acute manic and depressive symptoms and in prophylaxis of manic and depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder. They review the literature on the efficacy of agents in any of these four roles to determine which if any agents meet this definition of mood stabilizer. METHOD: The authors conducted a comprehensive review of English-language literature describing peer-reviewed, U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality class A controlled trials in order to identify agents with efficacy in any of the four roles included in their definition of a mood stabilizer. The trials were classified as positive or negative on the basis of primary outcome variables. An "FDA-like" criterion of at least two positive placebo-controlled trials was required to consider an agent efficacious. The authors also conducted a sensitivity analysis by raising and relaxing the criteria for including trials in the review. RESULTS: The authors identified 551 candidate articles, yielding 111 class A trials, including 81 monotherapy trials with 95 independent analyses published through June 2002. Lithium, valproate, and olanzapine had unequivocal evidence for efficacy in acute manic episodes, lithium in acute depressive episodes and in prophylaxis of mania and depression, and lamotrigine in prophylaxis (relapse polarity unspecified). Thus, only lithium fulfilled the a priori definition of a mood stabilizer. Relaxing the quality criterion did not change this finding, while raising the threshold resulted in no agents fulfilling the definition. CONCLUSIONS: When all four treatment roles are considered, the evidence supported a role for lithium as first-line agent for treatment of bipolar disorder. The analysis also highlights unmet needs and promising agents and provides a yardstick for evaluating new treatment strategies.},

We explain empirical comorbidity patterns based on a network model of psychiatric symptoms, derived from an analysis of symptom overlap in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV).

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that a) half of the symptoms in the DSM-IV network are connected, b) the architecture of these connections conforms to a small world structure, featuring a high degree of clustering but a short average path length, and c) distances between disorders in this structure predict empirical comorbidity rates. Network simulations of Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder show that the model faithfully reproduces empirical population statistics for these disorders.

CONCLUSIONS: In the network model, mental disorders are inherently complex. This explains the limited successes of genetic, neuroscientific, and etiological approaches to unravel their causes. We outline a psychosystems approach to investigate the structure and dynamics of mental disorders.},

In this work, we investigated the effects that imaging gradient non-linearity have on reproducibility of multi-site human MRI. We applied an image distortion correction method based on spherical harmonics description of the gradients and verified the accuracy of the method using phantom data. The correction method was then applied to the brain image data from a group of subjects scanned twice at multiple sites having different 1.5 T platforms. Within-site and across-site variability of the image data was assessed by evaluating voxel-based image intensity reproducibility. The image intensity reproducibility of the human brain data was significantly improved with distortion correction, suggesting that this method may offer improved reproducibility in morphometry studies. We provide the source code for the gradient distortion algorithm together with the phantom data. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been much focus on the apparent heterogeneity of schizophrenic symptoms. By contrast, this article proposes a unifying account emphasizing basic abnormalities of consciousness that underlie and also antecede a disparate assortment of signs and symptoms. Schizophrenia, we argue, is fundamentally a self-disorder or ipseity disturbance (ipse is Latin for "self" or "itself") that is characterized by complementary distortions of the act of awareness: hyperreflexivity and diminished self-affection. Hyperreflexivity refers to forms of exaggerated self-consciousness in which aspects of oneself are experienced as akin to external objects. Diminished self-affection or self-presence refers to a weakened sense of existing as a vital and self-coinciding source of awareness and action. This article integrates recent psychiatric research and European phenomenological psychiatry with some current work in cognitive science and phenomenological philosophy. After introducing the phenomenological approach along with a theoretical account of normal consciousness and self-awareness, we turn to a variety of schizophrenic syndromes. We examine positive, then negative, and finally disorganization symptoms-attempting in each case to illuminate shared distortions of consciousness and the sense of self. We conclude by discussing the possible relevance of this approach for identifying early schizophrenic symptoms.},

abstract = {White matter (WM) mapping of the human brain using neuroimaging techniques has gained considerable interest in the neuroscience community. Using diffusion weighted (DWI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), WM fiber pathways between brain regions may be systematically assessed to make inferences concerning their role in normal brain function, influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences of network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate the detailed connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which has proved important to and controversial in the history of neuroscience. We model the WM damage in the notable case of Phineas P. Gage, in whom a "tamping iron" was accidentally shot through his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's WM connectivity have not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography (CT) image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical MRI and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed male subjects (aged 25-36), we computationally simulate the passage of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter (GM) and WM damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes. Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage to Mr. Gage's WM network may not have been more severe than expected from that of a similarly sized "average" brain lesion. These results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced by this noteworthy patient.},

abstract = {In the classical twin study, phenotypic variation is often partitioned into additive genetic (A), common (C) and specific environment (E) components. From genetical theory, the outcome of genotype by environment interaction is expected to inflate A when the interacting factor is shared (i.e., C) between the members of a twin pair. We show that estimates of both A and C can be inflated. When the shared interacting factor changes the size of the difference between homozygotes' means, the expected sibling or DZ twin correlation is .5 if and only if the minor allele frequency (MAF) is .5; otherwise the expected DZ correlation is greater than this value, consistent (and confounded) with some additional effect of C. This result is considered in the light of the distribution of minor allele frequencies for polygenic traits. Also discussed is whether such interactions take place at the locus level or affect an aggregated biological structure or system. Interactions with structures or endophenotypes that result from the aggregated effects of many loci will generally emerge as part of the A estimate.

Ellis {\&} Young suggested in 1990 that the Capgras delusion results from damage to a neurological system involved in orienting responses to seen faces based on their personal significance. This hypothesis predicts that people suffering the Capgras delusion will be hyporesponsive to familiar faces. We tested this prediction in five people with Capgras delusion. Comparison data were obtained from five middle-aged members of the general public, and a psychiatric control group of five patients taking similar anti-psychotic medication. Capgras delusion patients did not reveal autonomic discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar faces, but orienting responses to auditory tones were normal in magnitude and rate of initial habituation, showing that the hyporesponsiveness is circumscribed.},

abstract = {Signs and symptoms that are characteristic for depression include changes in the setpoint of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system, which in the majority of these patients result in altered regulation of corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol secretory activity. More refined analysis of the HPA system revealed that corticosteroid receptor (CR) signaling is impaired in major depression, resulting among other changes, in increased production and secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH, also frequently abbreviated CRF) in various brain regions postulated to be involved in the causality of depression. This article summarizes the clinical and preclinical data, supporting the concept that impaired CR signaling is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of depression. Mouse genetics, allowing for selective inactivation of genes relevant for HPA regulation and molecular pharmacology, dissecting the intracellular cascade of CR signaling, are the most promising future research fields, suited for identifying genes predisposing to depression. Focusing on these two research lines may also allow to gain insight into understanding how current antidepressants work and further, how more specific targets for future antidepressant drugs can be identified.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Major depression is a multifactorial disorder with many etiologic variables that are interrelated through developmental pathways. The authors used structural equation modeling to generate a developmental model for the etiology of major depression in women. METHOD: Data from 1,942 adult female twins, interviewed up to four times over a 9-year period, were used to construct a developmental model to predict depressive episodes in the year before the most recent interview. Eighteen risk factors in five developmental tiers were considered: 1) childhood (genetic risk, disturbed family environment, childhood sexual abuse, and childhood parental loss), 2) early adolescence (neuroticism, self-esteem, and early-onset anxiety and conduct disorder), 3) late adolescence (educational attainment, lifetime traumas, social support, and substance misuse), 4) adulthood (history of divorce and past history of major depression), and 5) the last year (marital problems, difficulties, and stressful life events). RESULTS: The best fitting model included six correlations and 64 paths, provided an excellent fit to the data, and explained 52{\%} of the variance in liability to episodes of major depression. The findings suggest that the development of risk for major depression in women results from three broad pathways reflecting internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and psychosocial adversity. CONCLUSIONS: Major depression is an etiologically complex disorder, the full understanding of which will require consideration of a broad array of risk factors from multiple domains. These results, while plausible, should be treated with caution because of problems with causal inference, retrospective recall bias, and the limitations of a purely additive statistical model.},

abstract = {This is a review of the relevant empirical literature concerning the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Most of this work has focused on Criteria A1 and A2, the two components of the A (Stressor) Criterion. With regard to A1, the review considers: (a) whether A1 is etiologically or temporally related to the PTSD symptoms; (b) whether it is possible to distinguish "traumatic" from "non-traumatic" stressors; and (c) whether A1 should be eliminated from DSM-5. Empirical literature regarding the utility of the A2 criterion indicates that there is little support for keeping the A2 criterion in DSM-5. The B (reexperiencing), C (avoidance/numbing) and D (hyperarousal) criteria are also reviewed. Confirmatory factor analyses suggest that the latent structure of PTSD appears to consist of four distinct symptom clusters rather than the three-cluster structure found in DSM-IV. It has also been shown that in addition to the fear-based symptoms emphasized in DSM-IV; traumatic exposure is also followed by dysphoric, anhedonic symptoms, aggressive/externalizing symptoms, guilt/shame symptoms, dissociative symptoms, and negative appraisals about oneself and the world. A new set of diagnostic criteria is proposed for DSM-5 that: (a) attempts to sharpen the A1 criterion; (b) eliminates the A2 criterion; (c) proposes four rather than three symptom clusters; and (d) expands the scope of the B-E criteria beyond a fear-based context. The final sections of this review consider: (a) partial/subsyndromal PTSD; (b) disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS)/complex PTSD; (c) cross- cultural factors; (d) developmental factors; and (e) subtypes of PTSD.

A 3-year follow-up (1997–1999) is reported of a general population of 4,045 psychosis-free persons and of 59 subjects in the Netherlands with a baseline diagnosis of psychotic disorder. Substance use was assessed at baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 3-year follow-up. Baseline cannabis use predicted the presence at follow-up of any level of psychotic symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.76, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.18, 6.47), as well as a severe level of psychotic symptoms (OR = 24.17, 95{\%} CI: 5.44, 107.46), and clinician assessment of the need for care for psychotic symptoms (OR = 12.01, 95{\%} CI: 2.24, 64.34). The effect of baseline cannabis use was stronger than the effect at 1-year and 3-year follow-up, and more than 50{\%} of the psychosis diagnoses could be attributed to cannabis use. On the additive scale, the effect of cannabis use was much stronger in those with a baseline diagnosis of psychotic disorder (risk difference, 54.7{\%}) than in those without (risk difference, 2.2{\%}; p for interaction = 0.001). Results confirm previous suggestions that cannabis use increases the risk of both the incidence of psychosis in psychosis-free persons and a poor prognosis for those with an established vulnerability to psychotic disorder.

abstract = {Considering the faculty for learning as a primary human characteristic and means to adaptation, any influence that may reduce this faculty becomes a hazard. Sensory and cognitive stimulation of inappropriate strength, both underload and overload, appears to be one such hazard. The central theme of this paper is overload, in contrast to writings in the 1950s and 1960s which dealt mainly with the ill effects of sensory and cognitive deprivation. The presentation consists of four parts: An account of the author's investigation in which the learning performance of students was correlated with varying input loads; critiques of overload by commentators of different backgrounds; the effects of input on man in the perspective of evolution and of brain-mind identity; a recommendation of physiological and biochemical testing of students exposed to varying input loads in correlation with their learning performance. The physical testing is either to ratify or to invalidate two conclusions reached in observations on the behavioral level. These conclusions are (1) that overload, quantitative or qualitative, obstructs the human capacity for learning, and that such interference may to some extent be a reflection of undesirable changes in autonomic conditions; and (2) that preventive measures can be taken by the structure of an input that reduces it in the perception of its receivers.},

abstract = {Hypersexual Disorder is currently being considered for inclusion in the DSM-5. To inform this process, we investigated the latent structure of the hypersexuality construct using Meehl's (1995) taxometric method. Data on sexual interests and behaviors were obtained from 2,101 general population males and females in Sweden and 716 male sex offenders from the United States. Taxometric analyses of self-report indicators of hypersexuality supported a dimensional interpretation of latent structure in both samples. These findings suggest that individual differences in hypersexuality are quantitative (matter of degree) rather than qualitative (difference in kind) in nature, at least when self-report data were used. This is another way of saying that hypersexuality is organized along a continuum of increasing sexual frequency and preoccupation, with clinical cases of hypersexuality falling at the upper end of the continuum or dimension. We conclude that the proposed inclusion of Hypersexual Disorder in the DSM-5 should acknowledge the lack of non-arbitrary breaks in the latent symptoms continuum which runs from very low to very high engagement in sexual behavior and preoccupation. The diagnostic threshold should therefore be decided from an analysis of external data on severity, comorbidity, and prognosis for individuals with sub-threshold and full diagnoses, respectively. Additionally, dimensional assessment of Hypersexual Disorder should be part of clinical diagnostic practice.},

METHOD: Patients were 2,584 children/adolescents and adults enrolled at specialized ED clinics in Sweden. DSM-IV diagnoses anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and "not otherwise specified" examples were compared with DSM-5 anorexia, bulimia, and binge ED, as well as atypical anorexia, subthreshold bulimia, and binge eating, purging disorder, and the residual unspecified category. Assessment methods included a semistructured diagnostic interview and self-ratings of ED and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: We studied age-separated diagnostic distributions and explained variance in clinical variables associated with the two systems. Results showed some improvement of diagnostic specification as well as a slight increase in explained variance. DISCUSSION: Remaining problems with the proposed changes were also highlighted, and possible further refinement is discussed.},

abstract = {In psychiatry, almost no one questions the legitimacy of asking whether a given psychiatric disorder is real. Similarly, in psychology, scholars debate the reality of such theoretical entities as general intelligence, superegos, and personality traits. And yet in both disciplines, little thought is given to what is meant by the rather abstract philosophical concept of “real.” Indeed, certain psychiatric disorders have passed from real to imaginary (as in the case of multiple personality disorder) and from imaginary to real (as in the case of post-traumatic stress disorder). Although metaphysical terms such as “real “ and “objective” are readily invoked in psychiatry and psychology, they are often obscure, lofty abstractions. In this book, Peter Zachar argues that metaphysical concepts are important and useful conceptual tools, but should not be treated as all-purpose blunt instruments.From the perspective of a scientifically inspired pragmatism, Zachar explores the essentialist bias, diagnostic literalism, and the concepts of natural kind and social construct. He also proposes a new model for the domain of psychiatric disorders, the imperfect community model, which avoids both relativism and essentialism. He uses this model to understand such recent controversies as the elimination of the bereavement exclusion for depression and the attempt to eliminate narcissistic personality disorder from the DSM-5.},

Methods: Desirable conceptual and psychometric features of tobacco dependence assessments were identified, including the types of outcomes against which such assessment should be validated. DSM-IV criteria were matched against these criteria and compared with other dependence measures. Results: DSM-IV criteria were found to be ambiguous, little used in tobacco research, and have relatively low predictive validity. Other dependence measures were found to have greater validity in the prediction of important dependence features such as relapse likelihood. Strength of urges to smoke on typical smoking days and during abstinence, markers of nicotine intake or frequency of smoking, and latency to smoke soon after waking were found to be useful dependence measures. Conclusion: The use and utility of DSM-5 will be enhanced by eliminating most DSM-IV criteria and addingnew onesbased on smoking pattern, smoking heaviness, and the severity of craving during periods of smoking and withdrawal.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on the identification of mental symptoms. On the assumption that they are 'natural kinds', the latter are routinely entered as correlational variables in empirical research. Published work on the philosophy of psychiatry has tended to concentrate on the concept of mental disorder or on individual symptoms but has given less attention to mental symptoms as a class. This paper deals specifically with the epistemology of mental symptoms, that is, with focusing on the nature of mental symptoms as a class of 'objects' and how the clinician gets to know them. In order to do this, mental symptoms can be explored from various perspectives, namely: (i) as types of objects, (ii) as structures, (iii) as definitions, (iv) as pockets of meanings, (v) as comprising constituents, (vi) as attractors in specific dialogical contexts, etc. In this paper, on account of space constraints, we deal only with the former 4 perspectives. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows mental symptoms to be unstable constructs with implications for both correlational research and further theoretical exploration.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that schizophrenia is associated with a wide range of cognitive impairments. Empirical findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia suffer from a "dysexecutive syndrome". However, the extent to which a general decline in neuropsychological function accounts for symptoms of executive dysfunction in schizophrenia is not clear. In this study, we examined further the nature and pattern of executive function in a sample of medication-naive patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia with a set of tests capturing the specific components of executive function. We also compared the performance of this clinical group with healthy controls. A total of 78 medication-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia were recruited from the Early Assessment Service for Young People with Psychosis (EASY). Another 60 healthy controls were recruited for comparison. All subjects participated in a comprehensive set of executive function tests assessing initiation, sustained attention, online updating, switching, attention allocation, inhibition, and non-executive function. The executive function of patients with first-episode schizophrenia was found to be compromised relative to healthy controls. However, unlike patients with established schizophrenia, first episode patients exhibited only a limited deficit in sustained attention. Moreover, the majority of executive function deficits did not correlate with intellectual functioning and memory impairment in a sub-group of first episode patients without intellectual impairment. These findings suggest that first-episode patients exhibit a specific pattern of executive dysfunction compared to healthy controls and patients with an established illness. This differential breakdown of executive function components is unlikely to be an artefact of general intellectual decline or memory impairment in schizophrenia. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to identify some potential associations between these alterations and the clinical manifestations of depression in a sample of Chinese origin. 565 depressed patients of Chinese Han region were collected and seven kinds of hormones in HPA and HPT axes were detected. A 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and a 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA-14) were used to evaluate the baseline condition of each patient. 519 patients were enrolled into analysis. The patients with dysfunction of HPA axis had susceptibility to agitation symptoms (HAMD9 item) and cognitive disorders (HAMD2, 3 and 9 items), while those with normal function of HPA axis had susceptibility to shallow sleep (HAMD5 item). The patients with dysfunction of HPT axis had susceptibility to difficulty in falling asleep (HAMD4 item), weight loss (HAMD16 item) and gastrointestinal symptoms (HAMD12 item). Besides, the patients with dysfunctions of both HPA and HPT axes showed remarkable retardation symptoms (HAMD8 item).

abstract = {Nonpsychotic anomalies of subjective experience were emphasized in both classic literature and phenomenological psychiatry as essential clinical features of schizophrenia. However, only in recent years, their topicality with respect to the construct validity of the concept of the schizophrenia spectrum has been explicitly acknowledged, mainly as a consequence of the increasing focus on early detection and prevention of psychosis. The current study tested the hypothesis of a specific aggregation of self-disorders (SDs, various anomalies of self-awareness) in schizophrenia-spectrum conditions, comparing different diagnostic groups; 305 subjects, previously assessed in the Copenhagen Schizophrenia Linkage Study, were grouped into 4 experimental samples, according to their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) main diagnosis: schizophrenia, (n = 29), schizotypal personality disorder (n = 61), other mental illness not belonging to the schizophrenia spectrum (n = 112), and no mental illness (n = 103). The effect of diagnostic grouping on the level of SDs was explored via general linear model and logistic regression. The diagnosis of schizophrenia and schizotypy predicted higher levels of SDs, and SDs scores were significantly different between spectrum and nonspectrum samples; the likelihood of experiencing SDs increased as well with the diagnostic severity. The findings support the assumption that SDs are a discriminant psychopathological feature of the schizophrenia spectrum and suggest their incorporation to strengthen its construct validity, with potential benefit for both early detection and pathogenetic research.},

abstract = {Transition to psychosis in at-risk individuals has markedly declined in recent years. So far it has never been discussed in detail that with the growing awareness and increasing availability of early psychosis services, a much broader diagnostic spectrum is now being seen in these services. Subsequently, subjects present with symptoms that meet psychosis risk on a purely psychometric basis but may be the phenotypical expression of another underlying mental disorder. Here we critically review four groups of symptoms and clinical features that are frequently reported by individuals with suspected psychosis risk states, yet share strong commonalities with other mental disorders and conditions: isolated hallucinations; unusual bodily perceptions, hypochondriatic fears and cenesthetic psychotic symptoms; depersonalization; obsessive-compulsive, overvalued and delusional ideas. Of the 616 individuals so far assessed in the Bruderholz Early Psychosis Outpatient Service for Adolescents and Young Adults, 218 (30.5{\{}{\%}{\}}) met ultra-high risk (UHR) criteria, 188 (86.2{\{}{\%}{\}}) of whom suffered from one of the four above-mentioned symptom groups. The appraisal of the diagnostic spectra and their overlapping symptoms constitute a tremendous challenge in the clinical assessment of each referred individual. The final conclusion of a clinical assessment should not end with the mere assignment - or non-assignment - to a presumed psychosis risk group, but needs to take into account the 'Gestalt' of these particular symptoms and clinical features and thus be based on many more facets than solely a psychometric or nosological approach. Such an approach may break down the heterogeneous psychosis risk group and enable appropriate treatment regimes.},

@article{Friston2015,
abstract = {We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes- optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations. A key aspect of these simulations is the similarity between precision updates and dopaminergic discharges observed in conditioning paradigms.},

@article{Cannon2009,
abstract = {As an epilogue to the themed papers on "Theories of Schizophrenia" in this issue of Schizophrenia Bulletin, this article reviews some basic philosophy of science principles in regard to the role of theories in the evolving state of a natural science discipline. While in early phases inductive and abductive logic are the primary vehicles for organizing observations and developing models, when a critical set of "facts" have been elucidated which can be explained by competing theoretical perspectives, hypothetico-deductive logic provides a more robust and efficient approach to scientific progress. The key principle is to determine where two or more theories predict different observations and then to devise studies that collect critical observations-correlations or experimental outcomes that are predicted differentially by the competing theories. To a large extent, current theories of schizophrenia (eg, focusing on aberrant dopaminergic signaling, neural dysconnectivity, and disrupted neural development) are not (and are not intended by their authors to be) mutually exclusive of each other. Rather, they provide explanations that differ in relative emphases, eg, on distal vs proximal causes and on broad vs narrow behavioral end points. It is therefore possible for all of them to be "right" at least in a general sense. This non-exclusivity is problematic when considered in light of the strong inferences principles characteristic of a mature natural science discipline. The contrast points are likely to be found in constructions that integrate influences across different levels of analysis, as in additive vs interactive models, direct effects vs mediation models, and developmental vs deteriorative models.},

abstract = {The rise of molecular epigenetics over the last few years promises to bring the discourse about the sociality and susceptibility to environmental influences of the brain to an entirely new level. Epigenetics deals with molecular mechanisms such as gene expression, which may embed in the organism "memories" of social experiences and environmental exposures. These changes in gene expression may be transmitted across generations without changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetics is the most advanced example of the new postgenomic and context-dependent view of the gene that is making its way into contemporary biology. In my article I will use the current emergence of epigenetics and its link with neuroscience research as an example of the new, and in a way unprecedented, sociality of contemporary biology. After a review of the most important developments of epigenetic research, and some of its links with neuroscience, in the second part I reflect on the novel challenges that epigenetics presents for the social sciences for a re-conceptualization of the link between the biological and the social in a postgenomic age. Although epigenetics remains a contested, hyped, and often uncritical terrain, I claim that especially when conceptualized in broader non-genecentric frameworks, it has a genuine potential to reformulate the ossified biology/society debate.},

abstract = {The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group proposed the elimination of diagnostic criterion sets in favor of a prototype matching system that defines personality disorders using narrative descriptions. Although some research supports this general approach, no empirical studies have yet examined the specific definitions proposed for DSM-5. Given the wide interest in borderline personality disorder (BPD), it is crucial to determine how this methodological shift might affect the content and conceptualization of the diagnosis. Eighty-two experts on BPD provided ratings of the DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5 version of BPD in terms of 37 traits proposed for DSM-5. Analyses revealed significant and meaningful differences among the two constructs, with the DSM-5 version evincing increased interpersonal dependency but a decreased emphasis on antagonism and disinhibition. A second study within a clinical sample demonstrated that both antagonism and disinhibition mediated the relationships between DSM-IV BPD and impairment, suggesting that the proposed changes might have important consequences for BPD's coverage, prevalence, and nomological network. More globally, our results illustrate that unanticipated shifts in diagnostic constructs can stem from seemingly minor revisions and suggest that research is needed to understand how these, or other changes, might affect our conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of BPD.

abstract = {Compromised neurocognition is a core feature of schizophrenia. Following Heinrichs and Zakzanis's (1998) seminal meta-analysis of middle-aged and predominantly chronic schizophrenia samples, the aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of neurocognitive findings from 47 studies of first-episode (FE) schizophrenia published through October 2007. The meta-analysis uses 43 separate samples of 2,204 FE patients with a mean age of 25.5 and 2,775 largely age- and gender-matched control participants. FE samples demonstrated medium-to-large impairments across 10 neurocognitive domains (mean effect sizes from -0.64 to -1.20). Findings indicate that impairments are reliably and broadly present by the FE, approach or match the degree of deficit shown in well-established illness, and are maximal in immediate verbal memory and processing speed. Larger IQ impairments in the FE compared to the premorbid period, but comparable to later phases of illness suggests deterioration between premorbid and FE phases followed by deficit stability at the group level. Considerable heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies, however, underscores variability in manifestations of the illness and a need for improved reporting of sample characteristics to support moderator variable analyses.},

In this article, we draw attention to what is arguably a more worrying possibility: that pharmaceuticals currently in widespread therapeutic use are already having unintended effects on these processes, and thus on moral decision making and morally significant behavior. We review current evidence on the moral effects of three widely used drugs or drug types: (i) propranolol, (ii) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and (iii) drugs that effect oxytocin physiology. This evidence suggests that the alterations to moral decision making and behavior caused by these agents may have important and difficult-to-evaluate consequences, at least at the population level. We argue that the moral effects of these and other widely used pharmaceuticals warrant further empirical research and ethical analysis.},

abstract = {Psychopathy is often used to settle disputes about the nature of moral judgment. The "trolley problem" is a familiar scenario in which psychopathy is used as a test case. Where a convergence in response to the trolley problem is registered between psychopathic subjects and non-psychopathic (normal) subjects, it is assumed that this convergence indicates that the capacity for making moral judgments is unimpaired in psychopathy. This, in turn, is taken to have implications for the dispute between motivation internalists and motivation externalists, for instance. In what follows, we want to do two things: firstly, we set out to question the assumption that convergence is informative of the capacity for moral judgment in psychopathy. Next, we consider a distinct feature of psychopathy which we think provides strong grounds for holding that the capacity for moral judgment is seriously impaired in psychopathic subjects. The feature in question is the psychopathic subject's inability to make sincere apologies. Our central claim will be this: convergence in response to trolley problems does not tell us very much about the psychopathic subject's capacity to make moral judgments, but his inability to make sincere apologies does provide us with strong grounds for holding that this capacity is seriously impaired in psychopathy.},

abstract = {In 2008, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) included in its new Strategic Plan the following aim: "Develop, for research purposes, new ways of classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures". The implementation of this aim was named the Research Domain Criteria project, or RDoC. RDoC is a programmatic initiative that will fund grants, contracts, early-phase trials, and similar activities for the purpose of generating studies to build a research literature that can inform future versions of psychiatric nosologies based upon neuroscience and behavioral science rather than descriptive phenomenology. RDoC departs markedly from the DSM and ICD processes, in which extensive workgroup meetings generate final and finely-honed sets of diagnoses that are modified in field tests only if problems with clinical utility arise. Rather, in keeping with its provenance as an experimental system, the RDoC provides a framework for conducting research in terms of fundamental circuit-based behavioral dimensions that cut across traditional diagnostic categories. While an important aim of the project is to validate particular dimensions as useful for eventual clinical work, an equally important goal is to provide information and experience about how to conceive and implement such an alternative approach to future diagnostic practices that can harness genetics and neuroscience in the service of more effective treatment and prevention. This paper summarizes the rationale for the RDoC project, its essential features, and potential methods of transitioning from DSM/ICD categories to dimensionally-oriented designs in research studies.},

abstract = {Treatment and prevention studies over the past decade have enrolled patients believed to be at risk for future psychosis. These patients were considered at risk for psychosis by virtue of meeting research criteria derived from retrospective accounts of the psychosis prodrome. This study evaluated the diagnostic validity of the prospective "prodromal risk syndrome" construct. Patients assessed by the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes as meeting criteria of prodromal syndromes (n = 377) from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study were compared with normal comparison (NC, n = 196), help-seeking comparison (HSC, n = 198), familial high-risk (FHR, n = 40), and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD, n = 49) groups. Comparisons were made on variables from cross-sectional demographic, symptom, functional, comorbid diagnostic, and family history domains of assessment as well as on follow-up outcome. Prodromal risk syndrome patients as a group were robustly distinguished from NC subjects across all domains and distinguished from HSC subjects and from FHR subjects on most measures in many of these domains. Adolescent and young adult SPD patients, while distinct from prodromal patients on definitional grounds, were similar to prodromals on multiple measures, consistent with SPD in young patients possibly being an independent risk syndrome for psychosis. The strong evidence of diagnostic validity for the prodromal risk syndrome for first psychosis raises the question of its evaluation for inclusion in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition).},

Kant reported that Hume's work woke him from his“dogmatic slumbers” andJeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume “caused the scales tofall” from his eyes.Charles Darwin regarded his work as a central influence on the theoryof evolution. The diverse directions in which these writers took whatthey gleaned from reading him reflect both the richness of theirsources and the wide range of his empiricism.

This question gives rise to the problem of mental causation (MC) and its associated threats of causal overdetermination, mental causal exclu- sion, and mental causal irrelevance. Some (e.g., Cynthia and Graham Macdonald, and Stephen Yablo) have suggested that understanding mental-physical realization in terms of the determinable/determinate relation (henceforth, ‘determination') provides the key to solving the problem of MC: if mental properties are deter- minables of their physical realizers, then (since determinables and determinates are distinct, yet don't causally compete) all three threats may be avoided. Not everyone agrees that determination can do this good work, however. Some (e.g., Douglas Ehring, Eric Funkhauser, and Sven Walter) object that mental-physical realization can't be determination, since such realization lacks one or other characteristic feature of determination. I argue that on a proper understanding of the features of determination key to solving the problem of MC these arguments can be resisted.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe the outcomes of subjects with suspected pre-psychotic state in Taiwan. Methods: A prospective clinical observation was performed on subjects recruited by referrals from a community-based population. Three pre-psychotic risk groups were established by means of clinical interviews: an ultra-high risk group (UHR; 59 subjects), an intermediate-risk group (IRG; 46 subjects), and a marginal-risk group (MRG; 48 subjects). Also recruited were 60 subjects with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 144 normal controls (NC group). All subjects were aged 16 to 32. years. Results: Of the 59 UHR subjects, 21 (35.6{\{}{\%}{\}}) converted to FEP, including 15 with schizophrenia (6 had relatively brief positive yet persistent prominent negative symptoms), 2 with schizophreniform disorder, 1 with schizoaffective disorder, 2 with brief psychotic disorder, and 1 with bipolar disorder. The cumulative ± SE rate of conversion to psychosis was 21.7{\{}{\%}{\}} ± 5.4{\{}{\%}{\}} at 6. months, 28.2{\{}{\%}{\}} ± 6.2{\{}{\%}{\}} at 12. months, 30.4{\{}{\%}{\}} ± 6.4{\{}{\%}{\}} at 18. months, and 33.3{\{}{\%}{\}} ± 6.8{\{}{\%}{\}} at 24. months. The UHR subjects who converted had a higher rate of initial antipsychotic use than those who did not convert. Only half of the IRG and two-thirds of the MRG subjects received follow-up, and none of them developed FEP. Conclusions: Our results lent support to both sides of the current debate regarding establishing a new diagnostic category of "psychosis risk syndrome." The divergent trajectories of the UHR subjects deserve more clinical attention, especially with regard to the use of antipsychotics and the presence of a group with prominent negative symptoms. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The DSM-5 Field Trials were designed to obtain precise (standard error,0.1) estimates of the intraclass kappa asa measure of the degree to which two clinicians could independently agree on the presence or absence of selected DSM-5 diagnoses when the same patient was interviewed on separate occasions, in clinical settings, and evaluated with usual clinical interview methods. METHOD: Eleven academic centers in the United States and Canada were selected,and each was assigned several target diagnoses frequently treated in that setting.Consecutive patients visiting a site during the study were screened and stratified on the basis of DSM-IV diagnoses or symptomatic presentations. Patients were randomly assigned to two clinicians for a diagnostic interview; clinicians were blind to any previous diagnosis. All data were entered directly via an Internet-based software system to a secure central server. Detailed research design and statistical methods are presented in an accompanying article. RESULTS: There were a total of 15 adult and eight child/adolescent diagnoses for which adequate sample sizes were obtained to report adequately precise estimates of the intraclass kappa. Overall, five diagnoses were in the very good range(kappa=0.60–0.79), nine in the good range(kappa=0.40–0.59), six in the questionable range (kappa = 0.20–0.39), and three in the unacceptable range (kappa values,0.20). Eight diagnoses had insufficient sample sizes to generate precise kappa estimates at any site. CONCLUSIONS: Most diagnoses adequately tested had good to very good reliability with these representative clinical populations assessed with usual clinical interview methods. Some diagnoses that were revised to encompass a broader spectrum of symptom expression or had a more dimensional approach tested in the good to very good range.},

abstract = {We review briefly the contributions of Skodol, Pincus, and Widiger (this issue) describing and critiquing the proposed changes in the assessment of personality and personality disorders for the DSM-5. Despite the hard work of the DSM-5 Work Group to date, there are shortcomings and areas of controversy in the current proposal that demand further attention and change. We discuss the controversy in the broader context of the DSM over the past 30 years. In addressing specific problems, we focus on the limitations of the proposed system for assessing traits (even as we endorse the movement toward dimensional assessment of personality) and the difficulties posed by the current "hybrid" model that attempts to include both traits and types. In moving forward, we suggest greater emphasis on decision-making regarding the presence and severity of any personality disorder (understood on the basis of generalized failures in adaptation) and greater flexibility in identifying the variants of personality disorders in order to accommodate both traits and types more inclusively during this transition toward dimensional approaches to assessment.},

In this work, gray matter abnormalities in late-life depression are examined in a systematic review and meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging studies. In the systematic review, 27 articles were identified that compared participants with late-life depression with comparison group participants, and 17 studies were suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses of volumes of the whole brain, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Volume reductions were detected in 7 of 15 comparisons of the hippocampus and a meta-analysis revealed a significant, but small, effect size. Although examined by fewer studies, meta-analyses also revealed significant volume reductions in the orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, and thalamus. A more systematic and comprehensive analysis of the global distribution of gray matter abnormalities, and an examination of subcortical abnormalities were identified as key areas for future research.},

abstract = {The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM) is an evolving document that serves the many mental health care disciplines as the primary reference guide for classifying mental disorders. While the successive framers of the DSM have attempted to base it on scientific evidence, political and economic factors have also shaped the conceptualization of mental illness. These economic and institutional forces have reinforced the DSM's use of a medical model in understanding psychopathology. Though the scientific evidence for a medical model is mixed and evidence for other types of conceptualizations have been given less attention, the medical model provides for reliable diagnoses that allot diverse benefits to treatment providers and researchers, as well as to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. This article will outline the development of a medical model of mental illness, highlighting connections between this model and corporate and political interests, and will show how this model relates to the various revisions of, and developments within, the DSM. Such an analysis is especially relevant today as the field looks towards the publication of the newest revision of the DSM and attempts to understand and integrate its proposed changes into current treatment, theory, and research. ?? 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do "rational" decisions as defined by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question ("Which heuristics do people use in which situations?") and the prescriptive question ("When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?"), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

abstract = {A pressing need for interrater reliability in the diagnosis of mental disorders emerged during the mid-twentieth century, prompted in part by the development of diverse new treatments. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), third edition answered this need by introducing operationalized diagnostic criteria that were field-tested for interrater reliability. Unfortunately, the focus on reliability came at a time when the scientific understanding of mental disorders was embryonic and could not yield valid disease definitions. Based on accreting problems with the current DSM-fourth edition (DSM-IV) classification, it is apparent that validity will not be achieved simply by refining criteria for existing disorders or by the addition of new disorders. Yet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria dominate thinking about mental disorders in clinical practice, research, treatment development, and law. As a result, the modern DSM system, intended to create a shared language, also creates epistemic blinders that impede progress toward valid diagnoses. Insights that are beginning to emerge from psychology, neuroscience, and genetics suggest possible strategies for moving forward.},

Case notes of out patients with bipolar disorder were reviewed. Demographic details, and treatment recommendations were determined. The management of affective episodes was evaluated and compared with BAP guidelines. In 84 subjects, 224 affective episodes were identified. Treatment was consistent with BAP guidelines in 72{\{}{\%}{\}} of episodes. Mania was more likely to be managed in accordance with guidelines than depression or mixed episodes. The use of antidepressant medication was the most likely intervention to deviate from recommendations. Reasons for treatments at odds with the guidelines were identified.

abstract = {Neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by several disabling symptoms for which effective, mechanism-based treatments remain elusive. Consequently, more advanced non-invasive therapeutic methods are required. A method that may modulate brain activity and be viable for use in clinical practice is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It is a non-invasive procedure whereby a pulsed magnetic field stimulates electrical activity in the brain. Here, we focus on the basic foundation of rTMS, the main stimulation parametters, the factors that influence individual responses to rTMS and the experimental advances of rTMS that may become a viable clinical application to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The findings showed that rTMS can improve some symptoms associated with these conditions and might be useful for promoting cortical plasticity in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, these changes are transient and it is premature to propose these applications as realistic therapeutic options, even though the rTMS technique has been evidenced as a potential modulator of sensorimotor integration and neuroplasticity. Functional imaging of the region of interest could highlight the capacity of rTMS to bring about plastic changes of the cortical circuitry and hint at future novel clinical interventions.Thus, we recommend that further studies clearly determine the role of rTMS in the treatment of these conditions. Finally, we must remember that however exciting the neurobiological mechanisms might be, the clinical usefulness of rTMS will be determined by its ability to provide patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders with safe, long-lasting and substantial improvements in quality of life.},

abstract = {It is common to represent the history of American psychiatry by comparing it to a pendulum. In this metaphorical rendering, psychiatry has swung back and forth between extremes of emphasis on psyche (life events and inner conflict ruling etiological thinking, talk therapy dominating treatment) and soma (biochemical sources dominating etiological thinking, somatic treatments dominating treatment). This article argues that, while this metaphor is suited to capturing certain aspects of American psychiatric history, it distorts others by, for example, exaggerating the extent of dogmatism on either side and obscuring continuities in psychiatry's history. The article looks specifically at the reception by psychoanalysts to the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy. It shows that psychoanalytic views of ECT were diverse and more receptive to ECT than the pendulum metaphor might lead us to believe.},

Charles Moser, MD, PhD proposes the name Gender Dysphoria Disorder (GDD), which would only apply to those experiencing "persistent and profound discomfort." That may remove some of the stigma because transgenders not experiencing discomfort wouldn't be diagnosed with a mental disorder. "We need to help this committee that's a pretty conservative committee to shift language so it's less pathologizing and less sexist," Lev says. "If you look at the criteria, you may be surprised to learn that boys who don't engage in 'rough and tumble play' may have GID. That's an absurd criteria to include at this point in the world." "First of all, it is not going to happen because it would be a public relations disaster for psychiatry," Robert Spitzer writes. "There was already a little disaster when the initial DSM-IV put in the 'clinical significance' criterion that had the effect of requiring distress or impairment before pedophilia could be diagnosed. The APA wisely corrected that in the DSM-IV-TR."},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and debilitating anxiety disorders. However, few studies had been dedicated to the neurobiology underlying SAD until the last decade. Rates of non-responders to standard methods of treatment remain unsatisfactorily high of approximately 25{\%}, including SAD. Advances in our understanding of SAD could lead to new treatment strategies. A potential non invasive therapeutic option is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Thus, we reported two cases of SAD treated with rTMS Methods: The bibliographical search used Pubmed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scielo databases. The terms chosen for the search were: anxiety disorders, neuroimaging, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In most of the studies conducted on anxiety disorders, except SAD, the right prefrontal cortex (PFC), more specifically dorsolateral PFC was stimulated, with marked results when applying high-rTMS compared with studies stimulating the opposite side. However, according to the "valence hypothesis", anxiety disorders might be characterized by an interhemispheric imbalance associated with increased right-hemispheric activity. With regard to the two cases treated with rTMS, we found a decrease in BDI, BAI and LSAS scores from baseline to follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the application of low-rTMS over the right medial PFC (mPFC; the main structure involved in SAD circuitry) combined with high-rTMS over the left mPFC, for at least 4 weeks on consecutive weekdays, may induce a balance in brain activity, opening an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of SAD.},

abstract = {Late-onset major depression is thought to have a biological (vascular) basis, which could be a result of brain structure change. Vascular lesions can affect both the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), while most previous studies addressed WM abnormality. This study explored the disease- and symptom (history of suicide attempt) -related GM morphometry in elderly male patients with late-onset depression. A total of 70 patients with depression admitted to our geriatric psychiatric ward were investigated, and 26 age-matched males were recruited as controls. We used T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain cerebral structural information and adopted voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate brain volume change related to disease (depression vs control) and symptom (depression with history of suicide attempt vs depression without history of suicide attempt). Late-onset depression was associated with smaller volumes in several regions of GM (insula and the posterior cingulate region) and WM (subcallosal cingulate cortex, floor of lateral ventricles, parahippocampal region, insula, and the cerebellum). Compared with nonsuicidal counterpart, suicidal depression was associated with decreased GM and WM volume in the frontal, parietal, and temporal regions, and the insula, lentiform nucleus, midbrain, and the cerebellum. Marked regional volume reduction was noticed at dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Our results demonstrate that the development of suicidal behaviors in major depression is related to widespread but discrete volume reduction in several cortical and subcortical structures, fitting with the hypothesis that decreased cerebral volume in certain regions renders biological susceptibility to attempt suicide during depressive states.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This study provides an estimate of the prevalence of depression, and identifies associated medical and psychosocial factors, in elderly hospitalized patients with heart failure (HF) in Spain. METHODS: The study included 433 patients aged 65 years or more who underwent emergency admission at four Spanish hospitals between January 2000 and June 2001 and who had a primary or secondary diagnosis of HF. Depression was defined as the presence of three or more symptoms on the 10-item Geriatric Depression Scale. RESULTS: In total, 210 (48.5{\%}) study participants presented with depression: 71 men (37.6{\%}) and 139 women (57.0{\%}). Depression was more common in patients with the following characteristics: NYHA functional class III-IV (adjusted odds ratio or aOR=2.00, 95{\%} confidence interval or 95{\%} CI, 1.23-3.24), poor score on the physical domain of the quality-of-life assessment (aOR=3.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.98-4.99), being dependent for one or two basic activities of daily living (BADLs) (aOR=2.52; 95{\%} CI, 1.41-4.51), being dependent for {\textgreater} or =3 BADLs (aOR=2.47; 95{\%} CI, 1.20-5.07), being limited in at least one instrumental activity of daily living (aOR=2.20: 95{\%} CI, 1.28-3.79), previous hospitalization for HF (aOR=1.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.93-5.45), spending more than 2 hours/day alone at home (aOR=3.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.93-5.45), and being dissatisfied with their primary care physician (aOR=1.90; 95{\%} CI, 1.14-3.17). CONCLUSIONS: Depression is very common in elderly hospitalized patients with HF and is associated with several medical and psychosocial factors. The high prevalence of depression, the poorer prognosis for HF in patients with depressive symptoms, and the existence of simple diagnostic tools and effective treatment argue in favor of systematic screening for depression in these patients.},

METHOD: Searches of PsycINFO and Medline were conducted, and reference lists from articles and books were searched for additional relevant references. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: A valid and reliable assessment should be comprehensive and include the use of symptom rating scales, a clinical interview, neuropsychological testing, and the corroboration of patient reports. Specific diagnostic criteria that are more sensitive and specific to adult functioning are needed. In treatment, pharmacological interventions have the most empirical support, with the stimulants methylphenidate and amphetamine and the antidepressants desipramine and atomoxetine having the highest efficacy rates. Scientific research on psychosocial treatments is lacking, with preliminary evidence supporting the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication.},

The key linguistic-analytic point against Boorse (and other naturalists) is that, although defining disease value free, he (and they) continue to use the term with clear evaluative connotations. A descriptivist (value-entailing) analysis of disease would allow value-free definition consistently with value-laden use: but descriptivism fails when applied to mental disorder because it depends on shared values whereas the values relevant to mental disorders are highly diverse. A part-function analysis, similarly, although initially persuasive for physical disorders, fails with the psychotic mental disorders because these, characteristically, involve disturbances of the rationality of the person as a whole. The difficulties encountered in applying naturalism to mental disorders point, linguistic-analytically, to the possibility that there is, after all, an evaluative element of meaning, deeply hidden but still logically operative, in the concept of disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While it is increasingly recognized that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists into adulthood, there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for adult ADHD. In this article the authors describe and contrast competing approaches for diagnosis of adult ADHD used in clinical and research practice. METHOD: The authors review the Wender Utah criteria, DSM criteria, and laboratory assessment strategies for adult ADHD. Advantages and disadvantages of each approach are described, and recommendations are made as a basis for clinical assessment and future research. RESULTS: Both the Wender Utah criteria and DSM-based approaches identify significantly impaired ADHD adults with neurocognitive, biological, and treatment response patterns similar to pediatric ADHD patients. The Wender Utah criteria established the need for retrospective childhood diagnosis and recognize developmental differences in adult symptom expression. The Wender Utah criteria fail to identify patients with predominantly inattentive symptoms, exclude some patients with significant comorbid psychopathology, and diverge significantly from the DSM conception of ADHD. The DSM criteria have never been validated in adults, do not include developmentally appropriate symptoms and thresholds for adults, and fail to identify some significantly impaired adults who are likely to benefit from treatment. There are insufficient scientific data to justify use of laboratory assessment measures, including neuropsychological tests and brain imaging, in diagnosing adult ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Adult ADHD remains a clinical diagnosis. Clinicians should be flexible in application of the current ADHD criteria to adults. Additional research is required to validate adult diagnostic criteria.},

RESULTS: The results of univariate and multivariate analyses were negative: Psychotic and nonpsychotic depressed patients did not differ with respect to attempted suicide. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study support the notion that psychotic features do not increase the risk for the elderly depressed patients to attempt suicide.},

abstract = {Late-life depression (LLD) is a frequent complication of the ageing process, occurring in up to 5{\%} of community-dwelling elderly and in a higher proportion of subjects with coexistent medical illnesses. Its presence has been consistently associated with cognitive impairment, greater disability and increased mortality. Approximately half of patients with LLD have evidence of subcortical ischaemic damage in prefrontal circuits revealed by MRI. This might constitute the biological substrate of the cardinal symptoms of depression and of executive dysfunction. An important proportion of patients with LLD do not achieve remission of their depressive symptoms in spite of adequate pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment. In addition, a group of LLD patients progress to further impairment and disability in the form of a dementing disorder. There is an imperative need to develop new treatment strategies for LLD. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are safe and efficacious interventions that might be used in combination with other therapeutic options to improve treatment outcomes. However, there are still questions regarding the optimal way in which rTMS and dTCS should be delivered as well as to the way in which we may identify the subjects who will benefit the most from these interventions.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional study evaluated 189 participants using the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Mini-mental State Examination and the Katz and Lawton Index, to assess dependence regarding activities of daily living (ADL). RESULTS: Most of the participants were women, aged between 60 and 92 years, with low levels of educational attainment and personal income, and non-qualified occupations. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 56{\%}, but only 3{\%} had a psychiatric diagnosis registered in their medical records. Univariate analysis showed significant associations between depressive symptoms and low educational level and income, marital status, number of hospitalizations in the previous year, cognitive decline, dependence regarding basic and instrumental ADL, and death. After logistic regression, the only variables that remained significantly associated with depression were low educational level, dependence regarding basic ADL, and death. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms were independently associated with low educational level and dependence regarding basic ADL. Hospitalized elderly people with depressive symptoms were more likely to die. It is essential to diagnose and treat depression properly in this population to minimize its negative impacts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and executive function (EF) in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) is controversial. We aim to assess the influence of DUP on changes in EF over a 2-year period in subjects with early-onset FEP (first psychotic symptom before age 18) and less than 6 months of positive symptoms.

METHODS: A total of 66 subjects were included in the study (19 females [28.8{\%}], mean age 16.2 ± 1.6 years). The influence of DUP on changes in EF over the 2-year follow-up (expressed as a composite score of 5 cognitive abilities: attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and problem solving) was estimated using a multivariate linear regression model after removing the effect of intelligence quotient and controlling for age, gender, diagnosis, premorbid adjustment, severity of positive and negative symptoms at baseline, global functioning at baseline, and mean daily antipsychotic dosage during follow-up.

RESULTS: Mean DUP was 65.0 ± 6.9 days (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 51.2, 78.8). Median DUP was 47.5 days (range 2-180 days). Negative symptoms at baseline was the only variable significantly associated with EF at baseline (10.9{\%} of explained variance [e.v. 10.9{\%}], p=0.007). Only shorter DUP (e.v. 8.7{\%}, p=0.013) and greater severity of baseline negative symptoms (e.v. 10.0{\%}, p=0.008) were significantly associated with greater improvement in EF.

CONCLUSIONS: In early-onset FEP, shorter DUP was associated with greater improvement in EF over a 2-year follow-up period.},

abstract = {The pathophysiology of depression has been associated to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the use of salivary cortisol measures is increasingly being incorporated into research. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether salivary cortisol differs for patients with depression and control persons. We did a systematic review with sequential meta-analysis and meta-regression according to the PRISMA Statement based on comprehensive database searches for studies of depressed patients compared to control persons in whom salivary cortisol was measured. Twenty case-control studies, including 1354 patients with depression and 1052 control persons were identified. In a random-effects meta-analysis salivary cortisol was increased for depressed patients as compared to control persons on average 2.58. nmol/l (95{\%} C.I.: 0.95-4.21) p= 0.002 in the morning and on average 0.27. nmol/l (95{\%} C.I.: 0.03-0.51) p= 0.03 in the evening. In a fixed-effects model the mean difference was 0.58. nmol/l (95{\%} C.I.). Study sequential cumulative meta-analyses suggested random error for the finding of this rather small difference between groups. The reference intervals for morning salivary cortisol in depressed patients (0-29. nmol/l) and control persons (1-23. nmol/l) showed substantial overlap suggesting lack of discriminative capacity. These results should be interpreted with caution as the heterogeneity for the morning analysis was large and a funnel plot, suggested presence of bias. Further, in meta-regression analyses higher intra-assay coefficients of variation in cortisol kits (p= 0.07) and mean age (p= 0.08) were associated with a higher mean difference of morning salivary cortisol between depressed and controls, while gender and depression severity were not. Based on the available studies there is not firm evidence for a difference of salivary cortisol in depressed patients and control persons and salivary cortisol is unable to discriminate between persons with and without depression. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A number of structural brain imaging studies and meta-analytic reviews have shown that multiple subtle brain abnormalities are consistently found in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Several studies suggest that schizophrenia and affective psychoses share a largely common pattern of brain abnormalities. Aim of the present study was to compare, by means of a meta-analytic approach, brain structural abnormalities, as detected by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), found at the onset of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in order to address the question of the specificity of brain abnormalities across diagnostic groups. Forty-five studies were identified as suit-able for analysis. In both schizophrenic and bipolar patients significant overall effect sizes were demonstrated for intracranial, whole brain, total grey and white matter volume reduction as well as for an increase of lateral ventricular volume at disease onset. Thus, the available literature data strongly indicate that some brain abnormalities are already present in first-episode schizophrenia or bipolar disor-der and that there is a significant overlap of brain abnormalities in affective and non-affective psychotic disorders at the onset of the dis-ease. However, whole grey matter volume deficits and lateral ventricular enlargement appear to be more prominent in first-episode schizophrenia whereas white matter volume reduction seems more prominent in bipolar disorder. The common vs specific trajectories of brain pathomorphology in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Although structural neuroimaging methods have been widely used to study brain morphology in schizophrenia, synthesizing this literature has been difficult. With the increasing popularity of voxel-based morphometric (VBM) methods in which group differences are reported in standardized coordinates, it is possible to apply powerful meta-analytic techniques initially designed for functional neuroimaging. In this study, we performed a voxelwise, coordinate-based meta-analysis to better conceptualize the neuroanatomic correlates of schizophrenia. Methods: Thirty-one peer-reviewed articles, with a total of 1195 patients with schizophrenia contrasted with 1262 healthy volunteers, were included in the meta-analysis. Coordinates from each article were used to create a statistical map that estimated the likelihood of between-group gray matter density differences at every brain voxel. These results were subsequently entered into a network analysis. Results: Patients had reduced gray matter density relative to control subjects in a distributed network of regions, including bilateral insular cortex, anterior cingulate, left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and thalamus. Network analysis grouped these regions into four distinct networks that potentially represent different pathologic processes. Patients had increased gray matter density in striatal regions. Conclusions: This study expands on previous meta-analyses of the neuroanatomy of schizophrenia by elucidating a series of brain networks disrupted by the illness. Because it is possible that these networks are influenced by independent etiologic factors, this work should foster more detailed neural models of the illness and focus research designed to discover the mechanisms of gray matter reduction in schizophrenia. ?? 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

This article offers a philosophical analysis of the criteria, showing that the criteria are related to two different views of causality. The authors argue that the criteria of strength, specificity, consistency, experiment, and biological gradient are related to a probabilistic regularity view of causality, whereas the criteria of coherence, plausibility, and analogy are related to a generative view of causality. The criterion of temporality is not related to either view, but may in contrast be central in inferring direction from cause to effect. The authors illuminate the aim and limitations of the various criteria that need to be included when discussing them.},

@article{Fitzgerald2004,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent and nature of neuropsychological deficits in adolescents and young people with first episode psychosis (FEP), and to determine whether the pattern and extent of neuropsychological deficits varied according to diagnosis. METHOD: A total of 83 FEP subjects aged 13-25 years, and 31 healthy controls completed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, grouped into 10 cognitive domains. First episode psychosis subjects were stratified into three diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, affective disorders, substance-induced psychosis) and differences in cognitive profiles were examined. The contribution of demographic and clinical characteristics to cognitive performance was also explored. RESULTS: The schizophrenia group demonstrated significantly worse performance on tasks of verbal learning and memory than the affective disorders group. Compared to healthy controls, the schizophrenia group also demonstrated global impairment across the majority of cognitive domains. The substance-induced group's performance lay between that of the schizophrenia and affective disorders groups. Analyses of differential deficits revealed that verbal learning, verbal memory and current intellectual functioning were selectively impaired in the schizophrenia group, whereas the affective disorders group demonstrated a selective deficit in speeded processing. Premorbid intellectual functioning, negative symptomatology and medication levels were the strongest predictors of cognitive performance in FEP subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Verbal memory deficits differentiate individuals with schizophrenia from those with psychotic affective disorders. Although significant cognitive deficits are evident across all diagnostic FEP groups, individuals with schizophrenia appear to have more generalized impairment across a broad array of cognitive functions than other psychotic diagnoses. Lower premorbid intellectual functioning does not appear to contribute to greater cognitive deterioration following onset of psychosis, but severity of illness may be a more important factor than levels of mood disturbance.},

@article{Gaudiano2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) is being proposed for inclusion in Section III of DSM-5 for those impaired by subthreshold psychotic symptoms that are not better accounted for by another diagnosis and not meeting criteria for a psychotic disorder. The rationale is to identify patients who are at high risk for transition to a psychotic disorder in the near future. However, the potential impact of using this new diagnosis in routine clinical practice settings has not been carefully examined. METHOD: As part of the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, a treatment-seeking psychiatric outpatient sample (n = 1,257) recruited from June 1997 to June 2002 completed a self-report measure of psychiatric symptoms and afterward were administered structured clinical interviews. For the current post hoc study, we investigated the prevalence rate of endorsing attenuated psychotic experiences to identify patients who could potentially meet criteria for APS. RESULTS: After the exclusion of those with lifetime DSM-IV psychotic disorders, psychotic experiences remained highly prevalent in the sample (28{\{}{\%}{\}} reported at least 1 psychotic experience during the past 2 weeks), and rates were similar across all major DSM-IV diagnostic categories. Only 1 patient (0.08{\{}{\%}{\}}) reported psychotic experiences but did not meet criteria for another current DSM disorder; however, this individual endorsed other nonpsychotic symptoms of greater severity. Psychotic experience endorsement was positively correlated with nearly all other nonpsychotic symptom domains, and multivariate analysis showed that general clinical severity predicted endorsement of psychotic experiences (P values {\{}{\textless}{\}} .001). CONCLUSIONS: We could not identify any patients who clearly met criteria for APS alone in our sample. Psychotic experiences appear to be common in outpatients and represent nonspecific indicators of psychopathology. Diagnosing APS in the community could result in high rates of false-positives or high rates of APS "comorbidity" with other nonpsychotic disorders, leading to the increased use of antipsychotic medications without clear need. Therefore, the clinical utility of adding APS to the diagnostic system remains highly questionable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: White-matter hyperintensities have been associated with both schizophrenia and mood disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, but results are inconsistent across studies.

AIMS: To examine whether white-matter hyperintensities are a vulnerability marker for psychosis or are specifically associated with bipolar disorder.

METHOD: T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired in 129 individuals with first-episode psychosis (either affective or non-affective psychoses) and 102 controls who were randomly selected from the same geographical areas. Visual white-matter hyperintensity ratings were used for group and subgroup comparisons.

RESULTS: There were no statistically significant between-group differences in white-matter hyperintensity frequency or severity scores. No significant correlations were found between white-matter hyperintensity scores and duration of illness, duration of untreated psychosis, or severity of psychotic, manic or depressive symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS: White-matter hyperintensities are not associated with vulnerability to psychosis in general, or specifically with affective psychoses. Further, first-episode psychosis investigations using more quantitative methods are warranted to confirm these findings.},

In this connection, the many occasions through the years on which I had the privilege to discuss with Einstein epistemological problems raised by the modern development of atomic physics have come back vividly to my mind and I have felt that I could hardly attempt anything better than to give an account of these discussions which, even if no complete concord has so far been obtained, have been of greatest value and stimulus to me. I hope also that the account may convey to wider circles an impression of how essential the open-minded exchange of ideas has been for the progress in a field where new experience has time after time demanded a reconsideration of our views.},

abstract = {Comorbidity of substance use disorders with physical and mental disorders was investigated among 1249 consecutive psychiatric consultation patients admitted to six general hospitals in Finland. Of the patients 354 (28{\%}) were diagnosed with substance use disorders (ICD-10), of which 22{\%} were due to use of at least two different types of psychoactive substances. Alcohol dependence (117/226) in male patients and acute drug intoxication (49/128) at a similar rate as alcohol dependence (44/128) in female patients were the most common clinical conditions. With few exceptions, all substance use disorders were comorbid and in 63{\%} of affected patients comprised a "triple diagnosis" (i.e., physical, mental, and substance use diagnoses concurrently). Poisonings and personality disorders in both sexes, digestive system diseases in men, and injuries in women were related to substance use disorders. Conclusions for service provision were: (1) the high level of co-occurrence of physical and mental disorders with substance use disorders calls for comprehensive, multi-disciplinary assessment of any substance use problems ascertained in psychiatric consultations; (2) poisoning with substance use involvement and mental comorbidity was the most common combined clinical condition justifying provision of addiction psychiatric emergency consultations in general hospitals; (3) polydrug use indicating severe problems and complex treatment needs should be identified; and (4) psychiatric referrals of patients with physical alcohol-related disorders should be ensured in general hospitals.},

Por isso, deixou-se de lado imensa quantidade de literatura muito rica, mas contendo apenas reflex{\~{o}}es e opini{\~{o}}es a respeito. Este trabalho divide-se em duas partes. Na primeira, uma introdu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o sobre os principais conceitos acerca de religi{\~{a}}o, espiritualidade e f{\'{e}}, al{\'{e}}m de definir os diferentes tipos do uso da express{\~{a}}o sa{\'{u}}de mental. A seguir examinou-se as caracter{\'{i}}sticas da religi{\~{a}}o saud{\'{a}}vel, comparando-as com as da religi{\~{a}}o que pode ser prejudicial {\`{a}} sa{\'{u}}de mental. Apresentou-se os diferentes mecanismos pelos quais a religi{\~{a}}o pode influenciar {\'{a}} sa{\'{u}}de e detalhou-se o que os trabalhos mostram sobre a rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre religi{\~{a}}o, sa{\'{u}}de f{\'{i}}sica, bem estar e os diferentes transtornos mentais. Os problemas metodol{\'{o}}gicos do estudo da religi{\~{a}}o na psiquiatria foram abordados e as principais recomenda{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es encontradas na literatura detalhadas. Na segunda parte, resumiu-se a literatura sobre transtornos mentais em ministros religiosos, ficando evidente que o tema foi muito pouco estudado. Os trabalhos s{\~{a}}o antigos, de muito antes do in{\'{i}}cio de cuidados como crit{\'{e}}rios e instrumentos diagn{\'{o}}sticos. Examinou-se tamb{\'{e}}m a literatura sobre os fatores de estresse na vida do sacerdote. Para investigar a preval{\^{e}}ncia de transtornos mentais entre ministros religiosos crist{\~{a}}os, n{\~{a}}o cat{\'{o}}licos moradores da cidade de S{\~{a}}o Paulo, 750 question{\'{a}}rios contendo o “Self-Report Psychiatric Screening Questionnaire (SRQ-20)” e o “Invent{\'{a}}rio da Vida Religiosa” foram enviados pelo correio.

A preval{\^{e}}ncia de transtornos mentais no m{\^{e}}s que precedeu a entrevista foi de 12.5{\%}, e 47{\%} receberam um diagn{\'{o}}stico quando a vida toda foi considerada.

abstract = {Backgrounds: It still remains unclear whether individuals who experience attenuated psychotic symptoms are likely to seek help, whereas depressive symptoms are more likely to be associated with help-seeking behavior than these symptoms themselves. The aims of our study were to compare the profile of these symptoms between clinical and community samples and to investigate to what extent help-seeking behavior depends on the severity of psychosis-like symptoms and/or depressive symptoms. Methods: The clinical sample consisted of help-seeking outpatients aged 16-30. years who had approached a community mental health clinic (N = 750, mean age: 23.3 ?? 4.2. years, 62.4{\{}{\%}{\}} females). The community sample was comprised of students from two universities and two high schools (N = 781, mean age: 18.1 ?? 1.7. years, 59.2{\{}{\%}{\}} females). Psychosis-like experiences were assessed using the PRIME Screen-Revised (PS-R), a self-reported screening instrument for assessing the risk of psychosis. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), a 20-item self-reported questionnaire. Results: Among the clinical and community samples, 27{\{}{\%}{\}} and 10{\{}{\%}{\}} had positive PS-R results respectively. No significant difference in the PS-R total score or the frequency of PS-R-positive items was observed between the clinical and community samples. A logistic regression analysis revealed that none of the psychosis-like experiences were significantly associated with help-seeking behavior, after controlling for the effect of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings showed that attenuated psychotic symptoms do not contribute significantly to help-seeking behavior, suggesting that the relationships among PLEs, depressive symptoms, and help-seeking behavior should be reconsidered. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Braga2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Several terms in the scientific literature about posttraumatic stress disorder are used with different meanings in studies conducted by different authors. Words such as trauma, violence, catastrophe, disaster and barbarism are often used vaguely or confusingly, and their meanings change in different articles. The lack of conceptual references for these expressions complicates the organization of literature. Furthermore, the absence of clear concepts may be an obstacle to clinical treatment because the use of these words by the patients does not necessarily point to a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder.DISCUSSION:A critical review of scientific literature showed that stress can be divided in stages to facilitate specific terminological adjustments to the event itself, to the subject-event interaction and to psychological responses. Moreover, it demonstrated that the varying concept of trauma expands into fundamental psychotherapeutic definitions and that the meanings of violence associated with barbarism are an obstacle to resilience. Therefore, this study updates the etymological origins and applications of these words, connects them to the expansions of meanings that can be operated in the clinical care of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, and analyzes them critically according to the criterion A of DSM-IV and ICD-10.SUMMARY:The terminology in the literature about posttraumatic stress disorder includes a plethora of terms whose meanings are not fully understood, and that, therefore, limit this terminology. The analysis of these terms suggested that the transformation of the concept of trauma led to a broader understanding of this phenomenon in its psychic dimensions, that a barbarian type of violence constitutes an obstacle to resilience, and that the criterion A of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 shows imprecision and conceptual fragilities.METHODS:To develop this debate article, a current specialized literature review was achieved by searching and retrieving the key terms from two major databases: PubMed and PsycINFO. The key terms included "disaster", "catastrophe", "barbarism", "terrorism", "trauma", "psychic trauma" and "violence", also in combination with the terms "PTSD", "concept" and "conceptual aspects". The data were captured specially from review articles. The included studies were those mostly identified by the authors as relevant by the presence of a conceptual approach in any part of the paper. Researches that relied solely on empirical indicators, like psychopathological, neurobiological or pharmacological aspects, were excluded. The focus here was in conceptual aspects, even when some few empirical studies were included.As it was noted a paucity of medical references related to conceptual aspects of these terms, a wider literature needed to be included, including chapters, books and articles proceeded from the Humanities areas. "Interdisciplinary research is needed in this area to include perspectives from a range of different disciplines" once that "to promote public health (...) new dimensions of such interactions and the implications thereof should be pursued in collaboration with researchers from broader areas" [1].},

abstract = {There is considerable debate over whether bipolar and related disorders that share common signs and symptoms, but are currently defined as distinct clinical entities in DSM-IV and ICD-10, may be better characterized as falling within a more broadly defined "bipolar spectrum". With a spectrum view in mind, the possibility of broadening the diagnosis of bipolar disorder has been proposed. This paper discusses some of the rationale for an expanded diagnostic scheme from both clinical and research perspectives in light of potential drawbacks. The ultimate goal of broadening the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is to help identify a common etiopathogenesis for these conditions to better guide treatment. To help achieve this goal, bipolar researchers have increasingly expanded their patient populations to identify objective biological or endophenotypic markers that transcend phenomenological observation. Although this approach has and will likely continue to produce beneficial results, the upcoming DSM-IV and ICD-10 revisions will place increasing scrutiny on psychiatry's diagnostic classification systems and pressure to re-evaluate our conceptions of bipolar disorder. However, until research findings can provide consistent and converging evidence as to the validity of a broader diagnostic conception, clinical expansion to a dimensional bipolar spectrum should be considered with caution.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the available high quality evidence-base of studies of adjunctive pharmacologic treatment for acute mania. METHOD: Double-blind controlled trials with adequate samples (n {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 100) were identified through search of PubMed/MEDLINE and computerized abstracts from 2004-2006 meetings of the American Psychiatric Association, International Conference on Bipolar Disorder, and Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacolium using key words mania, adjunct, and combination. RESULTS: Placebo-controlled studies with positive results support the adjunctive use of five agents including valproate, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and haloperidol. Agents with only negative or failed placebo-controlled studies included carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, and ziprasidone. We found no placebo-controlled study of many commonly used agents including lithium, aripiprazole, and clozapine. No studies explicitly excluded subjects, based on prior treatment with the monotherapy being offered and several studies limited randomization to patients with documented inadequate response to the monotherapy arm. CONCLUSION: The available placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials support adjunctive therapy combining lithium or valproate with olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol or quetiapine. The additional increment of antimanic efficacy of these combinations over monotherapy was similar in magnitude to that seen for the same agents as monotherapy in comparison with placebo. These additive benefits enhanced the tolerability of adverse effects sufficiently to allow a higher proportion of subjects receiving combination therapies to complete the studies than monotherapy treated patients. The available data has several shortcomings and the available studies are inadequate to conclusively determine whether combination treatment is more efficacious than monotherapy when used by subjects naive to both treatments. Nevertheless, adjunctive treatment, which combines agents with proven antimanic efficacy, offers an attractive option for patients with acute mania.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The psychosis-proneness-persistence-impairment model of psychotic disorder incorporates notions of both phenomenological and temporal continuity (persistence) of psychotic experiences (PE), but not structural continuity. Specific testable propositions of phenomenological continuity and persistence are identified. Method Propositions are tested by systematic reviews of the epidemiology of PE, persistence of PE and disorder outcomes, and meta-analyses (including Monte Carlo permutation sampling, MCPS) of reported rates and odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of PE obtained from 61 cohorts revealed a median annual incidence of 2.5{\{}{\%}{\}} and a prevalence of 7.2{\{}{\%}{\}}. Meta-analysis of risk factors identified age, minority or migrant status, income, education, employment, marital status, alcohol use, cannabis use, stress, urbanicity and family history of mental illness as important predictors of PE. The mode of assessment accounted for significant variance in the observed rates. Across cohorts, the probability of persistence was very strongly related to the rate of PE at baseline. Of those who report PE, {\{}{\~{}}{\}}20{\{}{\%}{\}} go on to experience persistent PE whereas for {\{}{\~{}}{\}}80{\{}{\%}{\}}, PE remit over time. Of those with baseline PE, 7.4{\{}{\%}{\}} develop a psychotic disorder outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Compelling support is found for the phenomenological and temporal continuity between PE and psychotic disorder and for the fundamental proposition that this relationship is probabilistic. However, imprecision in epidemiological research design, measurement limitations and the epiphenomenological nature of PE invite further robust scrutiny of the continuity theory.},

abstract = {Objective To assess whether the association between cognitive ability (IQ) and early mortality is mediated by socioeconomic status (SES) or whether the association between SES and mortality reflects a spurious association caused by IQ. Methods The participants were from the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (n=11321). IQ was assessed at age 16 to 23 years and the participants were followed up to 40 to 47 years of age. Results Controlling for sex, birth year, race/ethnicity, baseline health, and parental education, higher IQ was associated with lower probability of death (odds ratio per 1 standard deviation increase in IQ=0.78, 95{\%} confidence interval= 0.66, 0.91). This association disappeared (OR=0.99, CI=0.81, 1.20) when adjusted for education and household income. Adjustment for IQ had no effect on the association between SES and mortality. These findings were similar in Hispanic, Black, and White/other participants and in women and men. Parental education moderated the IQ-mortality association, so that this association was not observed in participants with low parental education. Conclusions Low IQ predicts early mortality in the U.S. population and this association is largely explained by SES. The results do not support the alternative hypothesis that the socioeconomic gradient in early mortality would reflect IQ differences.},

abstract = {The introduction of second-generation antipsychotics and cognitive therapies for schizophrenia over the past two decades generated considerable optimism about possibilities for recovery. To what extent have these developments resulted in better outcomes for affected individuals? What is the current state of our science and how might we address the many unmet needs in the prevention and treatment of schizophrenia? We trace the evolution of various treatments for schizophrenia and summarize current knowledge about available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. We consider the widely prevalent efficacy-effectiveness gap in the application of available treatments and note the significant variability in individual treatment response and outcome. We outline an individualized treatment approach which emphasizes careful monitoring and collaborative decision-making in the context of ongoing benefit-risk assessment. We note that the evolution of both pharmacological and psychosocial treatments thus far has been based principally on serendipity and intuition. In view of our improved understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia, there is an opportunity to develop prevention strategies and treatments based on this enhanced knowledge. In this context, we discuss potential psychopathological treatment targets and enumerate current pharmacological and psychosocial development efforts directed at them. Considering the stages of schizophrenic illness, we review approaches to prevent progression from the pre-symptomatic high-risk to the prodrome to the initial psychotic phase to chronicity. In view of the heterogeneity of risk factors, we summarize approaches towards targeted prevention. We evaluate the potential contribution of pharmacogenomics and other biological markers in optimizing individual treatment and outcome in the future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historical accounts of psychiatric classifications have hitherto been written in terms of a 'received view'. This contains two assumptions, that: (i) the activity of classifying is inherent to the human mind; and (ii) psychiatric 'phenomena' are stable natural objects. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to provide an outline of the evolution of psychiatric classifications from the perspective of conceptual history. This is defined as a theoretical and empirical inquiry into the principles, sortal techniques and contexts in which alienists carried out their task. It assumes that all psychiatric classifications are cultural products, and endeavours to answer the question of whether classificatory models imported from the natural sciences can be applied to man-made constructs (such as mental illness) definitionally based on 'personalised semantics'. METHODS: Exemplars of classificatory activity are first mapped and contextualised. Then, it is suggested that in each historical period crafting classifications has been like playing a game of chess with each move being governed by rules. This is illustrated by offering an analysis of the 1860-1861 French debate on classification. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: (1) Medicine is not a contemplative but a modificatory activity and hence classifications are only valuable if they can release new information about the object classified. (2) It should not be inferred from the fact that psychiatric classifications are not working well (i.e. that they only behave as actuarial devices) that they must be given up. Conceptual work needs to continue to identify 'invariants' (i.e. stable elements that anchor classifications to 'nature'. (3) Because mental disorders are more than unstable behavioural epiphenomena wrapped around stable molecular changes, 'neurobiological' invariants may not do. Stability depends upon time frames. Furthermore, it is unlikely that gene-based classifications will ever be considered as classifications of mental disorders. For once, they would have low predictive power because of their lack of information about the defining codes of mental illness. 'Social' and 'psychological' invariants have problems of their own.},

The Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Control of the WHO has created a special advisory group that should help it in considering the evidence and proposals made by scientists, governments, organizations and interested individuals and in producing the draft of the classification of mental disorders for inclusion into the 11th Revision of the ICD: This group has, in turn, developed several structures that will deal with the tasks that will arise in the revision process. At the same time the American Psychiatric Association has created a DSM 5 Task Force that should develop proposals for the 5th Revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual that will be published in 2012. The lecture will describe the processes and structures that have been put in place by the two organizations and refer to the issues that have arisen or are likely to arise in the course of work that should lead to the proposals for the ICD 11 and the DSM 5.},

Although a number of risk factors have been identified, specific features of suicidality in schizophrenia remain poorly understood. In this study, 19 patients with schizophrenia were interviewed in depth on their suicidal ideation and intentions, followed by a qualitative phenomenological analysis of the material. Solitude with inability to participate in human interactions and feelings of inferiority were found to be the main sources of suicidal ideation. These experiences seem to resemble ordinary depressive reactions, yet we found them to be reflective of a more basic self-alienation and incapacity for immersion in the shared world. Ignoring this experiential level of patients' disturbances may lead to trivialization (and misjudgment) of the experiences at the root of suicidality in schizophrenia.},

Their pooled effect size for mania improvement (Hedges' g in 48 trials) was 0.42 (confidence interval (CI): 0.36-0.48); pooled responder risk ratio (46 trials) was 1.52 (CI: 1.42-1.62); responder rate difference (RD) was 17{\{}{\%}{\}} (drug: 48{\{}{\%}{\}}, placebo: 31{\{}{\%}{\}}), yielding an estimated number-needed-to-treat of 6 (all p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.0001). In several direct comparisons, responses to various antipsychotics were somewhat greater or more rapid than lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine; lithium did not differ from valproate, nor did second generation antipsychotics differ from haloperidol. Meta-regression associated higher study site counts, as well as subject number with greater placebo (not drug) response; and higher baseline mania score with greater drug (not placebo) response. Most effective agents had moderate effect-sizes (Hedges' g=0.26-0.46); limited data indicated large effect sizes (Hedges' g=0.51-2.32) for: carbamazepine, cariprazine, haloperidol, risperidone, and tamoxifen. The findings support the efficacy of most clinically used antimanic treatments, but encourage more head-to-head studies and development of agents with even greater efficacy.},

Unfortunately, many leading candidate endophenotypes in schizophrenia have not been fully characterized simultaneously in large cohorts of patients and controls across these properties. The objectives of this study were to characterize the extent to which widely-used neurophysiological and neurocognitive endophenotypes are: 1) associated with schizophrenia, 2) stable over time, independent of state-related changes, and 3) free of potential practice/maturation or differential attrition effects in schizophrenia patients (SZ) and nonpsychiatric comparison subjects (NCS). Stability of clinical and functional measures was also assessed.},

Although other schools subsequently established such services, the first 50 years of college mental health were marked by a series of national conferences. At the American Student Health Association's annual meeting in 1920, "mental hygiene" was identified as critical for college campuses to assist students to reach their highest potential. However, it took another 40 years before mental health and psychological counseling services became common on college and university campuses. The American College Health Association formed a Mental Health Section to serve mental health professionals in 1957, and most colleges and universities have now developed mental health and counseling programs commensurate with the size of their student bodies.},

abstract = {At the center of medical morality is the healing relationship. It is defined by three phenomena: the fact of illness, the act of profession, and the act of medicine. The first puts the patient in a vulnerable and dependent position; it results in an unequal relationship. The second implies a promise to help. The third involves those actions that will lead to a medically competent healing decision. But it must also be good for the patient in the fullest possible sense. The physician cannot fully heal without giving the patient an understanding of alternatives such that he or she can freely arrive--together with the physician--at a decision in keeping with his or her personal morality and values. In today's pluralistic society, universal agreement on moral issues between physicians and patients is no longer possible. Nevertheless, a reconstruction of professional ethics based on a new appreciation of what makes for a true healing relationship between patient and physician is both possible and necessary.},

Along with analysis of clinical cases, the contributors recommend broad changes to DSM to incorporate new knowledge from psychiatry and neuroscience and findings from new methods of diagnostic testing. Advancing DSM is a rich treasury of intriguing information for all clinicians and researchers. You will -Develop an understanding of some of the shortfalls of the current system that will help you make better clinical decisions. Accurate diagnosis is the foundation for selecting the best treatment, determining prognosis, and enhancing our understanding of patients. With the help of real-world case examples, youAll develop a solid understanding of the complexities involved in making clinical diagnoses. -Learn about developments that will advance future editions of DSM. Find out how new developments in psychiatry and neuroscience and new diagnostic testing tools such as functional MRI are changing the face of psychiatric diagnosis and will inform future editions of DSM. -Be alerted to some of the vital questions that must be answered before a new DSM is developed. Each chapter raises important questions to answer if we are to develop new, more accurate, and more reliable diagnoses. For example, how do we determine the causes of mental disorders? How do we define a mental disorder? How should the groupings of disorders be revised to reflect information on etiology and pathophysiology? What are the implications of laboratory testing and neuroimaging for psychiatric diagnosis and practice? and many more. DSM has been a landmark achievement for the field. By allowing reliable diagnosis, it has brought order out of chaos and fostered groundbreaking advances in research and clinical care. Advancing DSM will brief you on exciting changes in psychiatry today that will impact the DSM of tomorrow.},

abstract = {The executive function (EF) is a set of abilities, which allows us to invoke voluntary control of our behavioral responses. These functions enable human beings to develop and carry out plans, make up analogies, obey social rules, solve problems, adapt to unexpected circumstances, do many tasks simultaneously, and locate episodes in time and place. EF includes divided attention and sustained attention, working memory (WM), set-shifting, flexibility, planning, and the regulation of goal directed behavior and can be defined as a brain function underlying the human faculty to act or think not only in reaction to external events but also in relation with internal goals and states. EF is mostly associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Besides EF, PFC is involved in self-regulation of behavior, i.e., the ability to regulate behavior according to internal goals and constraints, particularly in less structured situations. Self-regulation of behavior is subtended by ventral medial/orbital PFC. Impairment of EF is one of the most commonly observed deficits in schizophrenia through the various disease stages. Impairment in tasks measuring conceptualization, planning, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, ability to solve complex problems, and WM occur in schizophrenia. Disorders detected by executive tests are consistent with evidence from functional neuroimaging, which have shown PFC dysfunction in patients while performing these kinds of tasks. Schizophrenics also exhibit deficit in odor identifying, decision-making, and self-regulation of behavior suggesting dysfunction of the orbital PFC. However, impairment in executive tests is explained by dysfunction of prefronto-striato-thalamic, prefronto-parietal, and prefronto-temporal neural networks mainly. Disorders in EFs may be considered central facts with respect to schizophrenia and it has been suggested that negative symptoms may be explained by that executive dysfunction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuropsychological deficits have been reported in association with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Reductions in grey matter (GM) volumes have been documented in FEP subjects compared to healthy controls. However, the possible inter-relationship between the findings of those two lines of research has been scarcely investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between neuropsychological deficits and GM volume abnormalities in a population-based sample of FEP patients compared to healthy controls from the same geographical area. METHODS: FEP patients (n=88) and control subjects (n=86) were evaluated by neuropsychological assessment (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, forward and backward digit span tests) and magnetic resonance imaging using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Single-group analyses showed that prefrontal and temporo-parietal GM volumes correlated significantly (p{\textless}0.05, corrected) with cognitive performance in FEP patients. A similar pattern of direct correlations between neocortical GM volumes and cognitive impairment was seen in the schizophrenia subgroup (n=48). In the control group, cognitive performance was directly correlated with GM volume in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and inversely correlated with parahippocampal gyral volumes bilaterally. Interaction analyses with "group status" as a predictor variable showed significantly greater positive correlation within the left inferior prefrontal cortex (BA46) in the FEP group relative to controls, and significantly greater negative correlation within the left parahippocampal gyrus in the control group relative to FEP patients. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that cognitive deficits are directly related to brain volume abnormalities in frontal and temporo-parietal cortices in FEP subjects, most specifically in inferior portions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.},

abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test–retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

We use the Capgras delusion (the claim that one or more of one's close relatives has been replaced by an exact replica or impostor) to illustrate this argument. Our account maintains that people voicing this delusion suffer an impairment that leads to faces being perceived as drained of their normal affective significance, and an additional reasoning bias that leads them to put greater weight on forming beliefs that are observationally adequate rather than beliefs that are a conservative extension of their existing stock. We show how this position can integrate issues involved in the philosophy and psychology of belief, and examine the scope for mutually beneficial interaction.},

abstract = {In 1980 the American Psychiatric Association (APA), faced with increased professional competition, revised the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Psychiatric expertise was redefined along a biomedical model via a standardised nosology. While they were an integral part of capturing professional authority, the revisions demystified psychiatric expertise, leaving psychiatrists vulnerable to infringements upon their autonomy by institutions adopting the DSM literally. This research explores the tensions surrounding standardisation in psychiatry. Drawing on in-depth interviews with psychiatrists, I explore the 'sociological ambivalence' psychiatrists feel towards the DSM, which arises from the tension between the desire for autonomy in practice and the professional goal of legitimacy within the system of mental health professions. To carve a space for autonomy for their practice, psychiatrists develop 'workarounds' that undermine the DSM in practice. These workarounds include employing alternative diagnostic typologies, fudging the numbers (or codes) on official paperwork and negotiating diagnoses with patients. In creating opportunities for patient input and resistance to fixed diagnoses, the varied use of the DSM raises fundamental questions for psychiatrists about the role of the biomedical model of mental illness, especially its particular manifestation in the DSM.},

abstract = {The challenges posed by chronic illness have pointed out to epidemiologists the multifactorial complex nature of disease causality. This notion has been referred to as a web of causality. This web extends theoretically beyond risk markers. It includes determinants of emergence/non-emergence of disease. This web of determinants is a form of complex system. Due to its complexity, the determinants within such system are not linked to each others in a linear, predictable manner only. Predictability is possible only on a short-term basis, and unpredictability sets in over the long run. Understanding such a system of determinants calls for articulation and testing of complex models which synthesize our knowledge of multiple determinants at many scales, both biological and otherwise. Given the complexity of this web and existing knowledge about the nonlinearity of such systems, the following question is posed: Can the challenge of studying causality be adequately addressed if emphasis continues to be placed on using tools and methods that are geared towards looking at such system from a linear paradigm? Or is it time to add to the epidemiologic research agenda the notion of nonlinearity and its relevant form of analytical approaches that are being tested in other disciplines? Furthermore, the question posed here applies as well to the study of determinants of health. Addressing determinants of heath adds further complexity to our task.},

abstract = {Although structural brain alterations in schizophrenia have been demonstrated extensively, their quantitative distribution has not been studied over the last 14 years despite advances in neuroimaging. Moreover, a volumetric meta-analysis has not been conducted in antipsychotic-naive patients. Therefore, meta-analysis on cross-sectional volumetric brain alterations in both medicated and antipsychotic-naive patients was conducted. Three hundred seventeen studies published from September 1, 1998 to January 1, 2012 comprising over 9000 patients were selected for meta-analysis, including 33 studies in antipsychotic-naive patients. In addition to effect sizes, potential modifying factors such as duration of illness, sex composition, current antipsychotic dose, and intelligence quotient matching status of participants were extracted where available. In the sample of medicated schizophrenia patients (n = 8327), intracranial and total brain volume was significantly decreased by 2.0{\%} (effect size d = -0.17) and 2.6{\%} (d = -0.30), respectively. Largest effect sizes were observed for gray matter structures, with effect sizes ranging from -0.22 to -0.58. In the sample of antipsychotic-naive patients (n = 771), volume reductions in caudate nucleus (d = -0.38) and thalamus (d = -0.68) were more pronounced than in medicated patients. White matter volume was decreased to a similar extent in both groups, while gray matter loss was less extensive in antipsychotic-naive patients. Gray matter reduction was associated with longer duration of illness and higher dose of antipsychotic medication at time of scanning. Therefore, brain loss in schizophrenia is related to a combination of (early) neurodevelopmental processes-reflected in intracranial volume reduction-as well as illness progression.},

METHOD: Charts of 11 consecutive patients with delirium were retrospectively reviewed. These patients were given quetiapine fumarate, a novel antipsychotic, as first-line treatment for their symptoms. The charts of a control group of 11 patients treated with haloperidol, the standard treatment for delirium, during the same time period were also evaluated. The Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) was used to evaluate the efficacy of each treatment. RESULTS: Ten of 11 patients in both groups had {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 50{\{}{\%}{\}} improvement in DRS scores. There was no difference in onset of symptom resolution, duration of treatment, and overall clinical improvement. Quetiapine was better tolerated in these medically ill patients. CONCLUSION: Quetiapine appears to be an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for delirium. Further prospective studies are warranted.},

abstract = {In this article I will argue that we are witnessing at this moment the third wave of biological psychiatry. This framework conceptualizes mental disorders as brain disorders of a special kind that requires a multilevel approach ranging from genes to psychosocial mechanisms. In contrast to earlier biological psychiatry approaches, the mental plays a more prominent role in the third wave. This will become apparent by discussing the recent controversy evolving around the recently published DSM-5 and the competing transdiagnostic Research Domain Criteria approach of the National Institute of Mental Health that is build on concepts of cognitive neuroscience. A look at current conceptualizations in biological psychiatry as well as at some discussions in current philosophy of mind on situated cognition, reveals that the thesis, that mental brain disorders are brain disorders has to be qualified with respect to how mental states are constituted and with respect to multilevel explanations of which factors contribute to stable patterns of psychopathological signs and symptoms.},

Sample size-adjusted effect sizes (Cohen's d statistic) were calculated and averaged across baseline (before stressor onset), stress (stressor onset up to 25 min after stressor offset), and recovery (more than 25 min after stressor offset) periods. Overall, MDD and ND individuals exhibited similar baseline and stress cortisol levels, but MDD patients had much higher cortisol levels during the recovery period than their ND counterparts. There was also a significant time of day effect in which afternoon studies were more likely to reveal higher baseline cortisol levels, blunted stress reactivity, and impaired recovery in MDD patients. This blunted reactivity-impaired recovery pattern observed among the afternoon studies was most pronounced in studies with older and more severely depressed patients.},

abstract = {The field of affective neuroscience has emerged from the efforts of Jaak Panksepp in the 1990s and reinforced by the work of, among others, Joseph LeDoux in the 2000s. It is based on the ideas that affective processes are supported by brain structures that appeared earlier in the phylogenetic scale (as the periaqueductal gray area), they run in parallel with cognitive processes, and can influence behaviour independently of cognitive judgements. This kind of approach contrasts with the hegemonic concept of conscious processing in cognitive neurosciences, which is based on the identification of brain circuits responsible for the processing of (cognitive) representations. Within cognitive neurosciences, the frontal lobes are assigned the role of coordinators in maintaining affective states and their emotional expressions under cognitive control. An intermediary view is the Damasio-Bechara Somatic Marker model, which puts cognition under partial somatic-affective control. We present here our efforts to make a synthesis of these views, by proposing the existence of two interacting brain circuits; the first one in charge of cognitive processes and the second mediating feelings about cognitive contents. The coupling of the two circuits promotes an endogenous feedback that supports conscious processes. Within this framework, we present the defence that detailed study of both affective and cognitive processes, their interactions, as well of their respective brain networks, is necessary for a science of consciousness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The results of multiple studies on the association between antipsychotic use and structural brain changes in schizophrenia have been assessed only in qualitative literature reviews to date. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies on this association to quantitatively synthesize the findings of these studies.

METHODS: A systematic computerized literature search was carried out through MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS and PsycINFO databases aiming to identify all VBM studies addressing this question and meeting predetermined inclusion criteria. All studies reporting coordinates representing foci of structural brain changes associated with antipsychotic use were meta-analyzed by using the activation likelihood estimation technique, currently the most sophisticated and best-validated tool for voxel-wise meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies.

RESULTS: Ten studies (five cross-sectional and five longitudinal) met the inclusion criteria and comprised a total of 548 individuals (298 patients on antipsychotic drugs and 250 controls). Depending on the methodologies of the selected studies, the control groups included healthy subjects, drug-free patients, or the same patients evaluated repeatedly in longitudinal comparisons (i.e., serving as their own controls). A total of 102 foci associated with structural alterations were retrieved. The meta-analysis revealed seven clusters of areas with consistent structural brain changes in patients on antipsychotics compared to controls. The seven clusters included four areas of relative volumetric decrease in the left lateral temporal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 20], left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44), superior frontal gyrus extending to the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), and right rectal gyrus (BA 11), and three areas of relative volumetric increase in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24), left ventral anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24) and right putamen.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify the specific brain regions where possible associations between antipsychotic drug usage and structural brain changes in schizophrenia patients are more consistently reported. Additional longitudinal VBM studies including larger and more homogeneous samples of schizophrenia patients may be needed to further disentangle such alterations from those possibly linked to the intrinsic pathological progressive process in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Seven decades have elapsed since Leo Kanner described the syndrome he termed early infantile autism. Over this time, and particularly over the past two decades, noteworthy changes have occurred in how the condition is conceptualized. Here we provide an overview of these changes, beginning with a brief discussion of the significance of classification in general before discussing Kanner's original paper and subsequent changes. We touch on relevant issues, such as comorbidity, dimensional aspects of diagnosis and screening, and the complex issue of diagnosis relative to eligibility for services. Approaches to diagnosis have tended to swing from emphasizing overarching groups (lumping) to focusing on potentially distinct subgroups (splitting). Autism raises particular problems given the broad range of syndrome expression over age and developmental level. The most recent revision of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic taxonomy marks a significant departure from its predecessor and has been the focus of much debate. It remains unclear which of the currently existing categorical approaches will ultimately be most widely applied. We hope to convey a sense of areas in which consensus has been achieved and areas of continued controversy.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Freud argued that in conversion disorder (CD) the affect attached to stressful memories is "repressed" and "converted" into physical symptoms, although this has never been subject to scientific study to our knowledge. OBJECTIVE To examine the neural correlates of recall of life events judged to be of causal significance in CD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study. Academic research setting among 12 patients with motor CD and 13 healthy control subjects. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Stressful life events were assessed using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule and rated by a blinded panel for their likelihood to cause CD based on the threat posed and the extent to which subsequent illness might allow escape from some of their consequences (termed escape). Recall of those events (escape condition) was compared with recall of equally threatening control events from the same epoch (severe condition) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging task. RESULTS Relative to controls, patients showed significantly increased left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and decreased left hippocampus activity during the escape vs severe condition, accompanied by increased right supplementary motor area and temporoparietal junction activity. Relative to controls, patients failed to activate the right inferior frontal cortex during both conditions, and connectivity between amygdala and motor areas (supplementary motor area and cerebellum) was enhanced. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data offer support for the notion that the way adverse events are processed cognitively can be associated with physical symptoms in CD. Abnormal emotion (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior frontal cortex) and memory control (hippocampus) are associated with alterations in symptom-related motor planning and body schema (supplementary motor area and temporoparietal junction).},

abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually, but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning such as hindsight bias make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan prior to observing the research outcomes–a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are pre-existing. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the 12-month effects upon physical and mental health status of a diagnosis of major or minor depression among older medical inpatients. METHODS: Patients 65 years and older, admitted to the medical wards of two university-affiliated hospitals, with at most mild cognitive impairment, were screened for major and minor depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria). All depressed patients and a random sample of nondepressed patients were invited to participate. The physical functioning and mental health subscales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Two hundred ten patients completed the SF-36 at baseline and at one or more follow-ups. In multiple linear regression analysis for longitudinal data, adjusting for baseline level of the SF-36 subscale outcome, severity of physical illness, premorbid disability, age, sex and other covariates, patients with major depression at baseline had lower SF-36 scores at follow-up, in comparison to patients with no depression [physical health, 9.22 (95{\%} CI -15.52 to -2.93); mental health, 6.28 (95{\%} CI -11.76 to -0.79)]. CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of major depression in cognitively intact older medical inpatients is associated with sustained poor physical and mental health status over the following 12 months.},

However, empirical findings and methodological issues challenge the etiologic primacy of inhibitory and executive deficits in ADHD. Based on accumulating evidence of increased intra-individual variability in ADHD, we reconsider executive dysfunction in light of distinctions between 'hot' and 'cool' executive function measures. We propose an integrative model that incorporates new neuroanatomical findings and emphasizes the interactions between parallel processing pathways as potential loci for dysfunction. Such a reconceptualization provides a means to transcend the limits of current models of executive dysfunction in ADHD and suggests a plan for future research on cognition grounded in neurophysiological and developmental considerations.},

abstract = {This research is an attempt to gain a comprehensive insight into alexithymia in schizophrenia. Previous studies offered clinically-descriptive and phenomenologically oriented suggestions regarding alexithymia putative contribution in shaping schizophrenic psychopathology. However, the factorial structure of the scales used to assess alexithymia had never been applied to a schizophrenic sample as a preliminary step to interpret results, thus assuming the purported dimensions of the alexithymia construct (i.e. difficulties identifying feelings, difficulties describing feelings, and externally oriented thinking) to be transnosographically stable. In order to explore the psychopathologic meaning and interrelations with other schizophrenic symptoms, we evaluated 76 chronic schizophrenic outpatients using the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, standardized measures of positive, negative, disorganized and depressive symptoms, social and physical anhedonia scales, and the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms. The principal component analysis ofTAS-20 items revealed a 4-factor structure with multiple correlations with psychotic, disorganized, depressive, anhedonic dimensions and basic symptoms. The data suggest that alexithymia in schizophrenia is more heterogeneous than was previously recognized, and has several components, some of which are more state-related, and others of which are more like trait features. Those components are specifically correlated with both overt and subjective dimensions of schizophrenic psychopathology.},

We extended the scrutiny of social cognitive neuroscience into the domain of legal decisions, investigating two groups, lawyers and other academics, during moral and legal decision-making. While we found activation of brain areas comprising the so-called 'moral brain' in both conditions, there was stronger activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus particularly when subjects made legal decisions, suggesting that these were made in respect to more explicit rules and demanded more complex semantic processing. Comparing both groups, our data show that behaviorally lawyers conceived themselves as emotionally less involved during normative decision-making in general. A group × condition interaction in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex suggests a modulation of normative decision-making by attention based on subjects' normative expertise.},

AIMS: To identify the prevalence and pattern of substance use and misuse in first-episode psychosis, and relationships with diagnosis, mode of presentation and demographic variables. METHOD: Consensus diagnoses for 168 subjects presenting with first-episode psychosis were made using ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Information on substance use and misuse was obtained from multiple sources. We examined associations between substance misuse, diagnosis and demographic factors. RESULTS: Criteria for drug use, drug misuse or alcohol misuse were met by 37{\%} of the sample. One-year prevalence rates were 19.5{\%} (drug misuse) and 11.7{\%} (alcohol misuse). Thirteen subjects (8.4{\%}) received a primary diagnosis of substance-related psychotic disorder; a significant increase compared with an earlier cohort from the same catchment area. Drug misuse was associated with younger age of onset of psychosis, male gender and non-African-Caribbean ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms high rates of substance misuse at onset of psychosis. There is evidence for an increase in diagnosis of substance-related psychotic disorders over time. Those most at risk of substance misuse are young males.},

Considerable efforts have been devoted to identify and develop pharmacological agents that provide cognitive-enhancing benefits to patients with schizophrenia. However, results from studies are not univocal and the "real world" cognitive functioning gain provided by these agents seems disappointingly modest. Three issues are crucial in this respect. First, there is no convincing evidence that atypical agents are any better than typical agents in improving cognitive functioning. Second, even though studies observe statistically significant treatment effects on cognition, these gains are poor or imperceptible on a clinical and functional level. Third, studies do not report differences in treatment effect compared to placebo effect in terms of their cognitive enhancing effects. Finally, examples of interventions that do provide important and meaningful improvements in cognitive functioning in schizophrenia patients will be briefly presented.},

abstract = {A multidimensional trait system has been proposed for representing personality disorder (PD) features in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to address problematic classification issues such as comorbidity. In this model, which may also assist in providing scaffolding for the underlying structure of major forms of psychopathology more generally, 25 primary traits are organized by 5 higher order dimensions: Negative Affect, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Psychoticism. We examined (a) the generalizability of the structure proposed for DSM-5 PD traits, and (b) the potential for an integrative hierarchy based upon DSM-5 PD traits to represent the dimensions scaffolding psychopathology more generally. A large sample of student participants (N = 2,461) completed the Personality Inventory for DSM-5, which operationalizes the DSM-5 traits. Exploratory factor analysis replicated the initially reported 5-factor structure, as indicated by high factor congruencies. The 2-, 3-, and 4-factor solutions estimated in the hierarchy of the DSM-5 traits bear close resemblance to existing models of common mental disorders, temperament, and personality pathology. Thus, beyond the description of individual differences in personality disorder, the trait dimensions might provide a framework for the metastructure of psychopathology in the DSM-5 and the integration of a number of ostensibly competing models of personality trait covariation.

abstract = {What this paper adds What is already known about this subject - Iatrogenic amnesia is one of the main aetiologies of transient amnesia. - Benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs were considered to be the most responsible of iatrogenic amnesia. - Impact of drugs in memory disorders is more and more evocated in elderly people especially due to polymedication. What this study adds - An association between memory disorders and some drugs like benzodiazepines, antidepressants and older anticonvulsants was found as expected. - A strong association was found with unexpected drugs like benzodiazepine-like (zopiclone and zolpidem), SRI antidepressants and newer anticonvulsants. - Non neurotropic drugs like isotretinoin and cyclosporine were also associated with memory disorders. SUMMARY: Aims To investigate putative associations of reports of memory disorders and suspected drugs. Methods We used the case/non-case method in the French PharmacoVigilance Database (FPVD). Cases were reports of memory loss in the FPVD between January 2000 and December 2009. Non-case were all other reports during the same period. To assess association between memory impairment and drug intake, we calculated an odds ratio with its 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval. Results Among the 188 284 adverse drug reactions recorded, we identified 519 cases of memory loss. The sex ratio was 0.6 and the median age was 54 years (range 4-93). The maximal number of cases occurred between 40-49 years and 50-59 years. Evolution was favourable in 63{\{}{\%}{\}} of the cases. We found significant OR for benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, prazepam, clonazepam {\{}{\ldots}{\}}), hypnotics "benzodiazepines-like" (zolpidem, zopiclone), antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine), analgesics (morphine, nefopam, tramadol), anticonvulsants (topiramate, pregabalin, levetiracetam {\{}{\ldots}{\}}), antipsychotics (aripiprazole, lithium) and other drugs like trihexyphenidyl, cyclosporine and isotretinoin. Conclusions Our study confirmed an association between memory disorders and some drugs like benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants. But other drugs like hypnotics "benzodiazepines-like", newer anticonvulsants, SRI antidepressants, isotretinoin and cyclosporine were significantly associated with memory disorders although it was not or poorly described in literature. Taking account of limits of this study in the FPVD (under-reporting, notoriety bias {\{}{\ldots}{\}}), the case/non-case method allows to assess and detect associations between drugs exposure and a specific adverse drug reaction such as memory disorders, and could thus generate signals and orientate us to further prospective studies to confirm such associations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental disorders as defined by current classifications are not fully supported by scientific evidence. It is unclear whether main disorders should be broken down into separate categories or disposed along a continuous spectrum. In the near future, new classes of mental disorders could be defined through associations of so-called abnormalities observed at the genetic, molecular and neuronal circuitry levels.

METHODS: We propose an alternative hypothesis to these classifications based on an integrative, dynamical and multidimensional approach.

RESULTS: We suggest that observed data collected in the general population can be used to build a psychological landscape. Innovative techniques issued from information processing and system dynamics can prove helpful in this task. Information preserving techniques can reduce the high dimensional data collected and provide an intrinsic map for psychological characteristics or behaviors. Dynamical patterns called attractors, which are linked to each other through continuous pathways, can be identified. Specific attractors can define mental disorders. Their causal structure can be investigated with causal networks.

CONCLUSIONS: Powerful and reliable tools are available so that an alternative to current psychiatric classifications can be built based on a genuine biopsychosocial model. The proposed model is ready to be tested on real data.},

abstract = {The authors quantified, first, the effect of misclassified controls (i.e., individuals who are affected with the disease under study but who are classified as controls) on the ability of a case-control study to detect an association between a disease and a genetic marker, and second, the effect of leaving misclassified controls in the study, as opposed to removing them (thus decreasing sample size). The authors developed an informativeness measure of a study's ability to identify real differences between cases and controls. They then examined this measure's behavior when there are no misclassified controls, when there are misclassified controls, and when there were misclassified controls but they have been removed from the study. The results show that if, for example, 10{\%} of controls are misclassified, the study's informativeness is reduced to approximately 81{\%} of what it would have been in a sample with no misclassified controls, whereas if these misclassified controls are removed from the study, the informativeness is only reduced to about 90{\%}, despite the reduced sample size. If 25{\%} are misclassified, those figures become approximately 56{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively. Thus, leaving the misclassified controls in the control sample is worse than removing them altogether. Finally, the authors illustrate how insufficient power is not necessarily circumvented by having an unlimited number of controls. The formulas provided by the authors enable investigators to make rational decisions about removing misclassified controls or leaving them in.},

Dietary management entails a series of eating behavior changes regarding meal planning, food selection, food preparation, dining out, portion control, as well as appropriate responses to eating challenges. Diabetic patients encounter several difficulties in complying with the dietary regime. They exhibit restrictive eating behaviors, they express feelings of dietary deprivation, and rigid dietary control is perceived as the only way to a proper diet and weight management. However, pressure to conform to nutritional recommendations may render diabetics more prone to dietary under-reporting. Binge eating, restraint and body dissatisfaction frequently occur among these patients. Health professionals, therefore, need to take into account these difficulties in their collaboration with the patients in order to improve the effectiveness of nutrition intervention.},

abstract = {For every disorder, there is a set of established findings and accepted constructs upon which further understanding is built. The concept of schizophrenia as a disease entity has been with us for a little more than a century, although descriptions resembling this condition predate this conceptualization. In 1988, for the inaugural issue of Schizophrenia Research, at the invitation of the founding editors, a senior researcher, since deceased (RJ Wyatt) published a summary of generally accepted ideas about the disorder, which he termed "the facts" of schizophrenia. Ten years later, in conjunction with two of the authors (MSK, RT), he compiled a more extensive set of "facts" for the purpose of evaluating conceptual models or theoretical constructs developed to understand the nature of schizophrenia. On the 20th anniversary of this journal, we update and substantially expand our effort to periodically summarize the current body of information about schizophrenia. We compile a body of seventy-seven representative major findings and group them in terms of their specific relevance to schizophrenia -- etiologies, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatments. We rate each such "fact" on a 0-3 scale for measures of reproducibility, whether primary to schizophrenia, and durability over time. We also pose one or more critical questions with reference to each "fact", answers to which might help better elucidate the meaning of that finding for our understanding of schizophrenia. We intend to follow this paper with the submission to the journal of a series of topic-specific articles, critically reviewing the evidence.},

India had the highest absolute number of cases, the highest fatality rate, and the highest contribution of self-harm to burns admissions. The highest reported incidence was from Sri Lanka. Male victims generally predominated in Western countries, and females in the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent. Patients were grossly 10 years older in Europe than in Asia. The use and nature of fire accelerants, the possible roles of ethnicity, religion/faith and imitation are discussed. Three broad groups of victims were identified: psychiatric patients (Western and Middle-Eastern countries); those committing DSB for personal reasons (India, Sri Lanka, Papua-New Guinea, Zimbabwe); and those who are politically motivated (India, South Korea).

abstract = {The concept of narrative identity implies a continuity of the personal past, present and future. This concept is essentially based on the capacity of persons to integrate contradictory aspects and tendencies into a coherent, overarching sense and view of themselves. In 'mature' neurotic disorders, this is only possible at the price of repression of important wishes and possibilities for personal development. Patients with borderline personality disorder lack the capacity to establish a coherent self-concept. Instead, they adopt what could be called a 'post-modernist' stance towards their life, switching from one present to the next and being totally identified with their present state of affect. Instead of repression, their means of defence consists in a temporal splitting of the self that excludes past and future as dimensions of object constancy, bonding, commitment, responsibility and guilt. The temporal fragmentation of the self avoids the necessity of tolerating the threatening ambiguity and uncertainty of interpersonal relationships. The price, however, consists in a chronic feeling of inner emptiness caused by the inability to integrate past and future into the present and thus to establish a coherent sense of identity. The paper outlines the concept of narrative identity and explores its disturbances in borderline personality disorder. Finally, the increasing prevalence of these disorders is linked to the development of a mainly externally driven, fragmented character in post-modern society.},

We hypothesized that a functional polymorphism (rs6318) of the 5HTR2C gene would be associated with HPA axis response to a laboratory stress protocol. The present sample consisted of 41 men (22 African Americans, 19 Caucasians). We found that at rest men with the more active rs6318 Ser23 C allele had similar cortisol values compared to those with the less active Cys23 G allele. During laboratory stress, however, men with the Ser23 C allele exhibited the predicted significantly higher cortisol levels (p{\textless}0.001), as well as larger increases in anger (p=0.08) and depressive mood (p=0.006) ratings, compared to the Cys23 G carriers. The increase in cortisol was significantly related to the increases in ratings of anger and depression assessed before and after the emotion induction, and these correlations became nonsignificant when rs6318 genotype was covaried. We conclude that genetic variation in 5HTR2C may be associated with HPA axis activation and stimulated by emotional stress, and also with both psychological and physiological endophenotypes that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is traditionally considered chronic and intractable. OBJECTIVE: To compare the course of BPD's psychopathology and social function with that of other personality disorders and with major depressive disorder (MDD) over 10 years. DESIGN: A collaborative study of treatment-seeking, 18- to 45-year-old patients followed up with standardized, reliable, and repeated measures of diagnostic remission and relapse and of both global social functioning and subtypes of social functioning. SETTING: Nineteen clinical settings (hospital and outpatient) in 4 northeastern US cities. PARTICIPANTS: Three study groups, including 175 patients with BPD, 312 with cluster C personality disorders, and 95 with MDD but no personality disorder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders and its follow-along version (the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders-Follow-Along Version) were used to diagnose personality disorders and assess changes in them. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation were used to diagnose MDD and assess changes in MDD and in social function. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of patients with BPD remitted. Remission of BPD was slower than for MDD (P {\textless} .001) and minimally slower than for other personality disorders (P {\textless} .03). Twelve percent of patients with BPD relapsed, a rate less frequent and slower than for patients with MDD (P {\textless} .001) and other personality disorders (P = .008). All BPD criteria declined at similar rates. Social function scores showed severe impairment with only modest albeit statistically significant improvement; patients with BPD remained persistently more dysfunctional than the other 2 groups (P {\textless} .001). Reductions in criteria predicted subsequent improvements in DSM-IV Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning scores (P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: The 10-year course of BPD is characterized by high rates of remission, low rates of relapse, and severe and persistent impairment in social functioning. These results inform expectations of patients, families, and clinicians and document the severe public health burden of this disorder.},

abstract = {People with psychotic disorders have reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. This difference is primarily due to increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease associated with antipsychotic drugs and with modifiable risk factors, including weight gain, low exercise, poor diet, and high prevalence of cigarette smoking. We review non-pharmacological interventions for physical health behaviour in patients with chronic and first-episode psychosis. Our findings suggest that weight loss and attenuation of weight gain are achievable but limited and might not persist beyond the end of an intervention. Evidence for smoking cessation interventions is scarce. The case for early intervention to prevent deterioration of physical health is strong. We propose a framework for development of interventions, which addresses three main factors largely absent in previous research: (1) examination of aetiological factors related to poor physical health, (2) theory-driven interventions that target aetiological factors, and (3) assessment of feasibility.},

abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a pathological disturbance of mood, characterized by waxing and waning manic, depressive and, sometimes distinctly mixed states. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made with certainty when the manic syndrome declares itself. Most individuals who are diagnosed with this disorder will experience both poles of the illness recurrently, but depressive episodes are the commonest cause of morbidity and, indeed, of death by suicide. Twin, adoption and epidemiological studies suggest a strongly genetic aetiology. It is a genetically and phenotypically complex disorder. Thus, the genes contributing are likely to be numerous and of small effect. Individuals with bipolar disorder also display deficits on a range of neuropsychological tasks in both the acute and euthymic phases of illness and correlations between number of affective episodes experienced and task performance are commonly reported. Current self-report and observer-rated scales are optimized for unipolar depression and hence limited in their ability to accurately assess bipolar depression. The development of a specific depression rating scale will improve the assessment of bipolar depression in both research and clinical settings. It will improve the development of better treatments and interventions. Guidelines support the use of antidepressants for bipolar depression. With regard to the adverse effects of antidepressants for bipolar depression, double-blind, placebo-controlled data suggest that antidepressant monotherapy or the addition of a tricyclic antidepressant may worsen the course of bipolar disorder. Importantly, adjunctive psychotherapies add significantly (both statistically and clinically) to the efficacy of pharmacological treatment regimens. The successful management of bipolar disorder clearly demands improved recognition of bipolar disorder and effective long-term treatment for bipolar depression as well as mania.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examines the use of substance abuse and mental health services among older adults with substance use disorders.

METHODS: Participants were members of Humana Cares, a subsidiary of Humana, Inc., a care management program for chronically ill Medicare Advantage members, between 2008 and 2010. All adults aged 65 and older with a substance use disorder identified with International Classification of Diseases-9 codes were included. We compared utilization of substance abuse and mental health services among participants with no psychiatric comorbidity (n = 585), with comorbid depression (n = 605), and with comorbid severe and persistent mental illness (severe and persistent mental illness, n = 95).

RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent utilized substance abuse services and 36{\%} utilized mental health services. After adjusting for covariates, comorbid depression (odds ratio = 4.27, 95{\%} confidence interval: 3.22-5.65) and severe and persistent mental illness (odds ratio = 10.75, 95{\%} confidence interval: 5.22-20.13) were independently associated with specialty service use (either substance abuse or mental health services).

CONCLUSION: Although few chronically ill older adults with substance use disorders in this Medicare Advantage program received any specialty substance abuse or mental health services, utilization was higher among those who had concurrent psychiatric disorders.},

First, computers don't give a damn, that is the problem with Artificial Intelligence. 








He then presents his ideas of 'holism': that brief segments of text cannot be understood in isolation.








1. holism of intentional interpretation
2. Common-sense holism
Has to do with those affirmation that don't make sense.
{\textgreater} What's so daunting about this, from the disegner's point of view, is that one never knows which little fact is going to be relevant next - which common-sense tidbit will make the next disambiguation 'obvious'.








{\textgreater} Common-sense holism is *real-time* holism - it is freshly relevant to each new sentence, and it can never e ignores. Even if a perfect dictionary and grammar were available, sentences like our three examples would still have to be disambiguated 'in real time,' by some appeal to common sense.








{\textgreater} This suggests that common sense can be organized only partially according to subject matter. Much of what we recognize as 'making sense' is not 'about' some topic for which we have a word or idiom, but rather about some (possibly unique) circumstance or episode, which a longer fragment leads us to 'visualize'.








{\textgreater} ... it seems that we imagine ourselves into the case, and then decide from within it what's plausible. 








3. Situational holism
{\textgreater} Correct understanding of a sentence depends not only on general common sense, but also on understanding the specific situation(s) to which it pertains. 








Here he uses examples like of the boy that sees the moon inside the well, and the 'situational ambiguity' is built how the text is presented, expressed.








One last thing he states is that the *situation holism* is even more characteristic of longer natural-language texts.








{\textgreater} Translators (who read the book first, naturally) must be very sensitive to such matters - to ure 'ran' or 'flew' instead of 'fled', for instance - on pain of spoiling the suspense.








4. Digression: hermeneutics








{\textgreater} Hermeneutics, in the classical (nineteenth-century) sense, is the 'science' of textual interpretation-ie, exegesis. It is often described as 'holistic,' on something like the following grounds: the meanings of particular passages, doctrines, and specialized ('technical') terms, are only apparent in the context of the whole;








5. Existential holism








{\textgreater} In the section on intentional interpretation, we noticed how naturally we construe chess-playing computers as "trying" to make good moves, and "wanting" to win. At the same time, however, I think we also all feel that the machines don't "really care" whether they win, or how they play-that somehow the game doesn't "matter" to them. What's behind these conflicting intuitions? It may seem at first that what machines lack is a "reason" to win: some larger goal that winning would subserve. But this only puts off the problem; for we then ask whether they "really care" about the larger goal. And until this question is answered, nothing has been; just as we now don't suppose pawns "matter" to computers, even though they subserve the larger goal of winning.

{\textgreater} The holisms, as presented, increase in difficulty relative to current Al techniques; and my own inclination (it's hardly more than that) is to regard the last, exis- tential holism, as the most fundamental of the four. Hence my opening remark: the trouble with Artificial Intelligence is that computers don't give a damn.},

abstract = {The proposed Risk Syndrome for Psychosis (RS) criteria are derived from the Ultra High Risk criteria (UHR) and prodromal or Clinical High Risk criteria (CHR), and consist of subthreshold or attenuated positive psychotic symptoms with operationalized recency and frequency criteria. The rationale behind the proposed inclusion of the RS in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSMV) is that several studies have found that the UHR/prodromal/CHR criteria predict onset of psychotic disorder, mainly schizophrenia, within a brief time period of a few years. Identifying individuals meeting these criteria thus affords the possibility of early intervention to prevent or delay onset of full blown psychotic disorder. However, the RS is yet to be properly validated. Additionally, there are potential dangerous unintended consequences of the reification of this syndrome as a formal diagnosis. Thus we feel it is premature to justify inclusion of the RS in the DSM. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Neuroscience has long had an impact on the field of psychiatry, and over the last two decades, with the advent of cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroimaging, that influence has been most pronounced. However, many question whether psychopathology can be understood by relying on neuroscience alone, and highlight some of the perceived limits to the way in which neuroscience informs psychiatry. Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience is a philosophical analysis of the role of neuroscience in the study of psychopathology. The book examines numerous cognitive neuroscientific methods, such as neuroimaging and the use of neuropsychological models, in the context of a variety of psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, dependence syndrome, and personality disorders. Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience includes chapters on the nature of psychiatry as a science; the compatibility of the accounts of mental illness derived from neuroscience, information-processing, and folk psychology; the nature of mental illness; the impact of methods such as fMRI, neuropsychology, and neurochemistry, on psychiatry; the relationship between phenomenological accounts of mental illness and those provided by naturalistic explanations; the status of delusions and the continuity between delusions and ordinary beliefs; the interplay between clinical and empirical findings in psychopathology and issues in moral psychology and ethics. With contributions from world class experts in philosophy and cognitive science, this book will be essential reading for those who have an interest in the importance and the limitations of cognitive neuroscience as an aid to understanding mental illness.},

abstract = {The categorization of gender identity variants (GIVs) as "mental disorders" in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association is highly controversial among professionals as well as among persons with GIV. After providing a brief history of GIV categorizations in the DSM, this paper presents some of the major issues of the ongoing debate: GIV as psychopathology versus natural variation; definition of "impairment" and "distress" for GID; associated psychopathology and its relation to stigma; the stigma impact of the mental-disorder label itself; the unusual character of "sex reassignment surgery" as a psychiatric treatment; and the consequences for health and mental-health services if the disorder label is removed. Finally, several categorization options are examined: Retaining the GID category, but possibly modifying its grouping with other syndromes; narrowing the definition to dysphoria and taking "disorder" out of the label; categorizing GID as a neurological or medical rather than a psychiatric disorder; removing GID from both the DSM and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD); and creating a special category for GIV in the DSM. I conclude that-as also evident in other DSM categories-the decision on the categorization of GIVs cannot be achieved on a purely scientific basis, and that a consensus for a pragmatic compromise needs to be arrived at that accommodates both scientific considerations and the service needs of persons with GIVs.},

abstract = {We present a set of techniques for embedding the physics of the imaging process that generates a class of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) into a segmentation or registration algorithm. This results in substantial invariance to acquisition parameters, as the effect of these parameters on the contrast properties of various brain structures is explicitly modeled in the segmentation. In addition, the integration of image acquisition with tissue classification allows the derivation of sequences that are optimal for segmentation purposes. Another benefit of these procedures is the generation of probabilistic models of the intrinsic tissue parameters that cause MR contrast (e.g., T1, proton density, T2*), allowing access to these physiologically relevant parameters that may change with disease or demographic, resulting in nonmorphometric alterations in MR images that are otherwise difficult to detect. Finally, we also present a high band width multiecho FLASH pulse sequence that results in high signal-to-noise ratio with minimal image distortion due to B0 effects. This sequence has the added benefit of allowing the explicit estimation of T2* and of reducing test-retest intensity variability. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

There exists overwhelming evidence that cannabis use can contribute to the onset of schizophrenia and poor outcome in patients with established psychosis. Therefore, understanding why patients use cannabis and whether they are motivated to change their habits is important. The evidence is that patients with psychosis use cannabis for the same reasons the general population does, to 'get high', relax and have fun. There is little support for the 'self-medication' hypothesis, while the literature points more towards an 'alleviation of dysphoria' model. There is a lack of research reporting on whether psychotic patients are ready to change their use of cannabis, which has obvious implications for identifying which treatment strategies are likely to be effective.},

abstract = {MethylomeDB (http://epigenomics.columbia.edu/methylomedb/index.html) is a new database containing genome-wide brain DNA methylation profiles. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in the mammalian brain. In human studies, aberrant DNA methylation alterations have been associated with various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, and depression. In this database, we present methylation profiles of carefully selected non-psychiatric control, schizophrenia, and depression samples. We also include data on one mouse forebrain sample specimen to allow for cross-species comparisons. In addition to our DNA methylation data generated in-house, we have and will continue to include published DNA methylation data from other research groups with the focus on brain development and function. Users can view the methylation data at single-CpG resolution with the option of wiggle and microarray formats. They can also download methylation data for individual samples. MethylomeDB offers an important resource for research into brain function and behavior. It provides the first source of comprehensive brain methylome data, encompassing whole-genome DNA methylation profiles of human and mouse brain specimens that facilitate cross-species comparative epigenomic investigations, as well as investigations of schizophrenia and depression methylomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Τhe aim of this study was to observe cortisol responses to a pharmacological challenge with 1 $\mu$g ACTH as a function of age and gender. PATIENTS: Twenty-one young (13 women and 8 men; mean age: 43∙48 ± 10∙52 years) and forty elderly (20 women and 20 men; mean age: 79 ± 6∙76 years) volunteers without overt acute or chronic disease participated in this study. MEASUREMENTS: Basal serum cortisol levels were measured, and cortisol values were obtained at 30 and 60 min after administration of 1 $\mu$g ACTH. Free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyrotrophin, prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), insulin-like growth factor-1, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, oestradiol levels in women and total testosterone levels in men were also measured at baseline. RESULTS: No differences were observed between the groups of older and younger individuals in baseline plasma cortisol levels and mean cortisol responses at 30 and 60 min postchallenge. In the elderly subjects, statistically lower cortisol responses were observed in men at 30 and 60 min after 1-$\mu$g ACTH challenge (540∙17 ± 112∙28 vs 670∙11 ± 146∙49 nmol/l in women, P = 0∙003 at 30 min, and 482∙24 ± 108∙14 vs 568∙04 ± 135∙73 nmol/l in women, P = 0∙03 at 60 min). Furthermore, significant lower values in PRL, IGF-1, DHEAS and T3 were detected in older subjects when compared to the younger age group. Interestingly, a higher incidence of individuals who did not achieve normal responses to 1-$\mu$g ACTH test ({\textgreater}497 nmol/l) was noted in the group of elderly male subjects. CONCLUSION: This study documents a marked gender effect in the elderly, in the cortisol response levels to 1-$\mu$g ACTH stimulation. Elderly men demonstrate a decreased responsiveness compared to women in the same age range.},

abstract = {We sought to validate the psychometric properties of a recently developed paradigm that aims to measure salience attribution processes proposed to contribute to positive psychotic symptoms, the Salience Attribution Test (SAT). The "aberrant salience" measure from the SAT showed good face validity in previous results, with elevated scores both in high-schizotypy individuals, and in patients with schizophrenia suffering from delusions. Exploring the construct validity of salience attribution variables derived from the SAT is important, since other factors, including latent inhibition/learned irrelevance (LIrr), attention, probabilistic reward learning, sensitivity to probability, general cognitive ability and working memory could influence these measures. Fifty healthy participants completed schizotypy scales, the SAT, a LIrr task, and a number of other cognitive tasks tapping into potentially confounding processes. Behavioural measures of interest from each task were entered into a principal components analysis, which yielded a five-factor structure accounting for approximately 75{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variance in behaviour. Implicit aberrant salience was found to load onto its own factor, which was associated with elevated "Introvertive Anhedonia" schizotypy, replicating our previous finding. LIrr loaded onto a separate factor, which also included implicit adaptive salience, but was not associated with schizotypy. Explicit adaptive and aberrant salience, along with a measure of probabilistic learning, loaded onto a further factor, though this also did not correlate with schizotypy. These results suggest that the measures of LIrr and implicit adaptive salience might be based on similar underlying processes, which are dissociable both from implicit aberrant salience and explicit measures of salience.},

This suggests that voluntary force perception is provided through a sense of effort and not through a sense of intramuscular tension. Nevertheless, experimental data show that the contribution of sensory input to effort awareness must not be dismissed. Sensory signals are not involved in generating a signal of effort but rather in calibrating and modulating its magnitude. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies revealed that many cortical structures are activated during tasks of voluntary muscular force perception.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION:In such tasks, the basal ganglia might support the coherence of cortical activity.},

abstract = {During the last decade, there was a debate concerning the true efficacy of anti-depressants. Several papers were published in scientific journals, but many articles were also published in the lay press and the internet both by medical scientists and academics from other disciplines or representatives of societies or initiatives. The current paper analyzes the articles authored by three representative opinion makers: one academic in medicine, one academic in philosophical studies, and a representative of an activists' group against the use of anti-depressants. All three articles share similar gaps in knowledge and understanding of the scientific data and also are driven by an 'existential-like' ideology. In our opinion, these articles have misinterpreted the scientific data, and they as such may misinform or mislead the general public and policy makers, which could have a potential impact upon public health. It seems that this line of thought represents another aspect of the stigma attached to people suffering from mental illness.},

There were significantly more male patients than controls in each of the 3 cohorts (117 [70{\%}] vs 91 [43{\%}]), but there were no significant differences in sex composition among the 3 cohorts. Patients had significantly reduced processing speed (Cohen{\textless}i{\textgreater}d{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 1.24;{\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 6.91 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−30{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and working memory deficits (Cohen{\textless}i{\textgreater}d{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 0.83;{\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 1.10 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−14{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) as well as a significant whole-brain fractional anisotropy deficit (Cohen{\textless}i{\textgreater}d{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 0.63;{\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 2.20 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−9{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}).

Diurnal rhythms are disturbed, there is increased resistance to the feedback action of glucocorticoids, excess cortisol may induce MDD, basal levels may be higher and the post-awakening cortisol surge accentuated in those at risk for MDD. Does this suggest new avenues for studying MDD or its clinical management?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: The relevant literature was reviewed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Cortisol contributes to genetic variants for the risk for MDD and the way that environmental events amplify risk. The corticoids' influence begins prenatally, but continues into adulthood. The impact of cortisol at each phase depends not only on its interaction with other factors, such as psychological traits and genetic variants, but also on events that have, or have not, occurred previously.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that the time is now right for serious consideration of the role of cortisol in a clinical context. Estimates of cortisol levels and the shape of the diurnal rhythm might well guide the understanding of subtypes of MDD and yield additional indicators for optimal treatment. Patients with disturbed cortisol rhythms might benefit from restitution of those rhythms; they may be distinct from those with more generally elevated levels, who might benefit from cortisol blockade. Higher levels of cortisol are a risk for subsequent depression. Should manipulation of cortisol or its receptors be considered as a preventive measure for some of those at very high risk of future MDD, or to reduce other cortisol-related consequences such as long-term cognitive decline?},

abstract = {The strong comorbidity between psychosis and substance use is already identifiable in early psychosis, raising the question of the direction of the association between substance use and psychosis onset. It has long been considered that this association was explained by the self-medication hypothesis. This hypothesis has been recently challenged by several prospective studies carried out in population-based samples, showing a dose-response relationship between cannabis exposure and risk of psychosis. This association was independent from potential confounding factors such as exposure to other drugs and pre-existence of psychotic symptoms. As a large percentage of subjects from the general population is now exposed to this drug, even a small increase in the risk of adverse effects may have significant deleterious consequences for the health of the population. Hence, reducing exposure to cannabis may contribute to prevention of some incident cases of psychosis. Regarding prognosis, persistent substance misuse after the onset of psychosis has a deleterious impact on clinical outcome. Therapeutic programs for subjects with dual diagnosis should be implemented early in the course of psychosis to maximise their impact on the course of illness. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Cannabis use is associated with an earlier age of onset of psychosis (AOP). However, the reasons for this remain debated. Methods: We applied a Cox proportional hazards model to 410 first-episode psychosis patients to investigate the association between gender, patterns of cannabis use, and AOP. Results: Patients with a history of cannabis use presented with their first episode of psychosis at a younger age (mean years = 28.2, SD = 8.0; median years = 27.1) than those who never used cannabis (mean years = 31.4, SD = 9.9; median years = 30.0; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; 95{\%} CI: 1.16–1.74; P {\textless} .001). This association remained significant after controlling for gender (HR = 1.39; 95{\%} CI: 1.11–1.68; P {\textless} .001). Those who had started cannabis at age 15 or younger had an earlier onset of psychosis (mean years = 27.0, SD = 6.2; median years = 26.9) than those who had started after 15 years (mean years = 29.1, SD = 8.5; median years = 27.8; HR = 1.40; 95{\%} CI: 1.06–1.84; P = .050). Importantly, subjects who had been using high-potency cannabis (skunk-type) every day had the earliest onset (mean years = 25.2, SD = 6.3; median years = 24.6) compared to never users among all the groups tested (HR = 1.99; 95{\%} CI: 1.50- 2.65; P {\textless} .0001); these daily users of high-potency cannabis had an onset an average of 6 years earlier than that of non-cannabis users. Conclusions: Daily use, especially of high-potency cannabis, drives the earlier onset of psychosis in cannabis users.},

@misc{Azorin2006,
abstract = {It is easy to forget that bipolar disorder, as we now know it, is a recent construct. About 100 years ago, Kraepelin described a recurrent affective disorder (1), but bipolar disorder was not differentiated from major depressive illness until the work of Leonhardt 50 years later (2). Bipolar disorder is now recognized as a potentially treatable psychiatric illness that has substantial mortality and high social and economic impact. Every aspect of its definition, boundaries, mechanisms, and treatment, however, is subject to debate. In fact, there is no objective measure that can determine that one has bipolar disorder or does not have it. Given these problems, we are far from a rigorous definition of bipolar disorder. Our current definition is syndromal and based on affective symptoms (DSM-IV). It is highly reliable, but the requirement of mania-like states is clearly a problem because, for most patients, the illness appears to start with depressive episodes, and a depressive first episode predicts a more severe course of illness (3). We need to understand bipolar illness well enough that we will no longer have to wait for a manic episode before we can make the diagnosis. We also must understand the illness well enough to avoid the corresponding problem of overdiagnosis. Neither underdiagnosis nor overdiagnosis provides a service to patients with this illness. Most of our current understanding of bipolar disorder is based on properties of patients experiencing depressive or manic syndromes; too little information is available on what predisposes people to these episodes and on the factors that determine the course of illness. The development of functional brain imaging techniques has the potential to identify neural processes that underlie bipolar disorder. If this promise is to be realized, however, we need a framework that can integrate brain imaging with basic, clinically observable processes of bipolar disorder. In developing this framework, we must question our assumptions about bipolar disorder. Is affective disturbance basic to bipolar disorder, or is affect an epiphenomenon of a more fundamental disturbance in regulating something like motivation, arousal, or reinforcement? How independent are the inherited mechanisms that underlie the symptomatic syndromes and course of bipolar disorder? Are there potential physiological or behavioral markers that can be used clinically to identify bipolar disorder before an individual is manic? The report by Kr ger et al. in this issue of the Journal touches on three potentially fundamentaland poorly understoodareas of bipolar disorder. The first is the presence of specific mechanisms leading to susceptibility to affective symptoms and, presumably, to episodes of illness. In this study, the focus is on regulation of responses to emotional stimuli. More important than the specific mechanism, however, is the development of a testable model based on specific mechanisms of susceptibility. It is not appreciated enough that the basis of bipolar disorder is not depression or mania; rather, bipolar disorder is an illness that confers abnormal susceptibility to these states. A second area is that of resilience. Protective mechanisms may prevent the occurrence of symptomatic illness in susceptible individuals. In this regard, it is tantalizing that first-degree relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder have been reported to function better in many spheres than comparison subjects (4). Kr ger et al. demonstrated that subjects with bipolar disorder differed from siblings of lithium-responsive subjects in medial frontal cortical responses to an experimental affective stimulus. The enhanced medial frontal cortex response was not found in an earlier study of healthy subjects carried out by the same investigators using the same instrument. One model of susceptibility to bipolar disorder, based on these findings, is that genetic susceptibility to bipolar disorder is related to the set of responses that was common to the three subject groups in the study by Kr ger et al. and that the ability to raise, rather than lower, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the medial frontal cortex is protective. Is this characteristic an additional property of some individuals who are otherwise susceptible to bipolar disorder (making the model somewhat more complex) or did the affective stimulus in healthy subjects lack the salience to activate this putative protective system? Finally, the observation that medial frontal cortical activity was increased in siblings and reduced in patients raises the possibility that this differential change is secondary to a response that occurs (or does not) elsewhere. Third, and perhaps most important, is the question of course of illness. Kraepelin (1) was the first of many to observe that impairment associated with recurrent affective disorders was related more to the degree of recurrence than to the severity of a given episode. Others have reported that course of illness is heterogeneoussome patients experience an episodic-stable course, and others have more mood instability with more frequent episodes, mixed states, and susceptibility to problems like substance abuse (5). Robust response to lithium appears to be familial (6) and to be related to the more episodic-stable course of illness (7). Therefore, there may be specific mechanisms that confer an unstable course or protect against it. This vital area is the focus of an almost secondary aspect of the study by Kr ger et al., the group of valproate responders. The lithium- and valproate-responsive subjects shared certain responses to the affective stimulus, including the reduction in medial frontal cortex rCBF that differentiated lithium-responsive subjects from their siblings. They differed in rCBF responses in the anterior cingulate cortex (increased in lithium responders and decreased in valproate responders) and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (decreased in valproate responders). Course of illness was quite different in these groups: lithium-responsive subjects did not have histories of substance use disorders and had been episode-free for at least 3 years, but valproate-responsive subjects had more complicated histories and had been relatively stable for only 6 months. The differences between the subject groups in rCBF responses to the emotional stimulus could be consequences of the differences in course of illness, could be mechanisms underlying it, or could result from complications of bipolar disorder such as substance abuse or trauma. These possibilities can generate testable hypotheses that will require genetic and physiological studies in addition to brain imaging. As powerful as functional brain imaging may be, it raises important questions that underscore the necessity of complementary, convergent experimental approaches. In general terms, these include the validity of voluntary mood-induction methods as a measure of susceptibility to affective episodes and the validity of the detailed inferred interpretations of presumed roles of specific brain areas. In terms of the specific design, a major strength of the study by Kr ger et al. was the use of groups with contrasting courses of illness and comparison of genetically similar patients and nonpatients. Aspects that raise questions are the lack of concurrent controls (comparison subjects were studied a year earlier using the same techniques and PET instrument), the small number of subjects, questions of whether either group of subjects is representative, the validity of voluntary mood-induction methods, and specific technical questions about the interpretations of the imaging techniques. Any of these matters could be discussed at length, but they are less important than the implications of the studys findings. If we are ever going to understand bipolar disorder in a useful manner, we will need to deconstruct the susceptibility, protective, and illness-course mechanisms that underlie the illness. Studies like the one by Kr ger and associates are important steps in this direction.

@article{Zisook2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Pre-DSM-III (where DSM is Diagnostic and Statistical Manual), a series of studies demonstrated that major depressive syndromes were common after bereavement and that these syndromes often were transient, not requiring treatment. Largely on the basis of these studies, a decision was made to exclude the diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) if symptoms could be "better accounted for by bereavement than by MDE" unless symptoms were severe and very impairing. Thus, since the publication of DSM-III in 1980, the official position of American Psychiatry has been that recent bereavement may be an exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of an MDE. This review article attempts to answer the question, "Does the best available research favor continuing the 'bereavement exclusion' (BE) in DSM-5?" We have previously discussed the proposal by the DSM-5 Mood Disorders Work Group to remove the BE from DSM-5. METHODS Prior reviews have evaluated the validity of the BE based on studies published through 2006. The current review adds research studies published since 2006 and critically examines arguments for and against retaining the BE in DSM-5. RESULTS The preponderance of data suggests that bereavement-related depression is not different from MDE that presents in any other context; it is equally genetically influenced, most likely to occur in individuals with past personal and family histories of MDE, has similar personality characteristics and patterns of comorbidity, is as likely to be chronic and/or recurrent, and responds to antidepressant conclude that the BE should not be retained in DSM-5.},

abstract = {In the initial stages of schizophrenia, the environment as perceived by the patient changes into a puzzling, mysterious and stage-like scenery. At the same time, objects or persons may gain an overwhelming physiognomic expression and may even fuse with the patient's body. The paper explains these different alterations using Husserl's concept of intentional perception on the one hand, and Merleau-Ponty's concept of embodied perception on the other hand. The first may also be understood as describing the intersubjective constitution of reality through common concepts which structure intentional perception. The latter points to the embodiment of the perceiving subject and uncovers our intimate connection with the world mediated by the lived body. Thus, in each perception, an active, intentional or 'gnostic' component and a bodily, 'pathic' component work together. On this basis, the alteration of schizophrenic perception in delusional mood may be described as a paralysis of intentionality, or of the 'gnostic' component of perception. The synthetic and sense-bestowing processes effective in perception are seriously disturbed. On the other hand, as a result of the disturbance of intentional perception, physiognomic and expressive properties are set free within the perceptual field. The 'pathic' component of perception becomes independent. Thus, the intersubjective constitution of reality is replaced by idiosyncratic meanings and qualities of perception, leading finally into delusional perception.},

@article{Denys2007,
abstract = {In their recent paper, Natalie Banner and Tim Thornton evaluate seven volumes of the Oxford University Press series "International Perspectives in Philosophy and Psychiatry," an international book series begun in 2003 focusing on the emerging interdisciplinary field at the interface of philosophy and psychiatry. According to Natalie Banner and Tim Thornton, the series represents a clear indication that the interdisciplinary field of philosophy of psychiatry has been flourishing lately. Philosophers and psychiatrists face a "new philosophy of psychiatry". However, the optimism which the "new" philosophy of psychiatry celebrates is precisely the exiling of philosophy from the foundations of psychiatry. The 150 year old belief that psychopathology cannot do without philosophical reflection has virtually disappeared from common psychiatric education and daily clinical practice. Though the discipline of psychiatry is particularly suited to contributions from philosophy, the impact of philosophy on psychiatry nowadays remains limited. With some exceptions, philosophical papers are embedded in a philosophical context inscrutable to ordinary psychiatrists. Much current philosophical work is perceived by psychiatrists as negativistic. I would encourage the field of psychiatry to incorporate once again basic philosophical attitudes which render possible true dialogue with philosophy and enrich both disciplines. The views developed here should not discredit the value and importance of Natalie Banner and Tim Thornton's paper and the excellent series "International Perspectives in Philosophy and Psychiatry." As Jaspers said "Everybody inclined to disregard philosophy will be overwhelmed by philosophy in an unperceived way".},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previously we proposed that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports a specific working memory (WM) subcomponent: the ability to represent and maintain context information necessary to guide appropriate task behavior. By context, we mean prior task-relevant information represented in such a form that it supports selection of the appropriate behavioral response. Furthermore, we hypothesized that WM deficits in schizophrenia reflect impaired context processing due to a disturbance in dorsolateral PFC. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine PFC activation in medication-naive, first-episode patients with schizophrenia during a WM, task-isolating context processing. METHODS: Fourteen first-episode, medication-naive patients with schizophrenia and 12 controls similar in age, sex, and parental education underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of an A-X version of the Continuous Performance Test. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia demonstrated deficits in dorsolateral PFC activation in task conditions requiring context processing but showed intact activation of posterior and inferior PFC. In addition, patients demonstrated intact activation of the primary motor and somatosensory cortex in response to stimulus processing demands. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate selectivity in dorsolateral PFC dysfunction among medication-naive first-episode patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that a specific deficit in PFC function is present at illness onset, prior to the administration of medication or the most confounding effects of illness duration. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that WM deficits in patients with schizophrenia reflect an impairment in context processing due to a disturbance in dorsolateral PFC function.},

METHODS: A narrative review of the literature and an overview of this special issue of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry. RESULTS: First, an operational definition of AVHs is offered. Next, clues to etiology are derived from a detailed consideration of the clinical phenomenology of "voices", their form and content. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies suggest the importance of left-side language areas in the generation/perception of AVHs. CONCLUSIONS: Existing cognitive neuropsychiatric models provide a useful framework for the understanding of AVHs. However, data need to be applied more specifically to these models so that they may be refined.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine, using a cross-twin cross-trait design, the hypotheses 1) that the genetic and environmental susceptibility to depression is expressed, in part, as alterations in cortisol day curves and 2) that cortisol abnormalities are not merely the consequence of depressive states or the stressors associated with its onset. Alteration of diurnal secretion of cortisol is a possible endophenotype of depression, as depressed patients show alterations in cortisol dynamics over the day. METHODS: Salivary cortisol measurements were obtained in a sample of 279 twin pairs at 10 random times a day for 5 days. A structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) axis I mood disorder (SCID) was administered. Using multilevel regression analysis, the moderating influence of a lifetime diagnosis of depression in the co-twin on the association between time of day and cortisol concentrations in the proband twin was examined. RESULTS: Diurnal variation in cortisol in the proband twin differed as a function of lifetime diagnosis of depression in the co-twin. In addition, this moderating effect was significantly stronger for dizygotic than for monozygotic twins. CONCLUSIONS: Probands of co-twins with lifetime depression have a different diurnal cortisol profile than those without, suggesting that altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning is an indicator of depression susceptibility.},

The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was long (mean = 114 weeks), as in other studies. Longer DUP was associated with poorer work, social, and global functioning in the year before admission, with more insidious onset of psychosis, and with more negative symptoms at first clinical presentation. Longer DUP was not associated with the age at onset of psychosis. These findings were mostly gender independent. The data help to frame questions about why patients can be psychotic for so long before getting help.

The grouping of mental disorders, or meta-structure, should arguably reflect knowledge on the validity of different conditions and their relationships, and should ideally contribute to improving the clinical utility of the nosology by guiding clinical assessment and management. The DSM-5 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Disorders Workgroup has reviewed the nature of anxiety disorders, the possibility of including a new category of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders in the DSM-5, and the concept of traumatic stress disorders. It is difficult to devise a perfect nosology that dissects nature at her joints; instead, any particular approach to the meta-structure would seem to have pros and cons that must be carefully weighed. Despite the imperfections of any meta-structure, we are hopeful that each revision of the nosology will bring with it greater diagnostic validity and clinical utility.},

In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain-emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.},

abstract = {The schizophrenia research community has invested substantial resources on collecting, managing and sharing large neuroimaging datasets. As part of this effort, our group has collected high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) datasets from individuals with schizophrenia, their non-psychotic siblings, healthy controls and their siblings. This effort has resulted in a growing resource, the Northwestern University Schizophrenia Data and Software Tool (NUSDAST), an NIH-funded data sharing project to stimulate new research. This resource resides on XNAT Central, and it contains neuroimaging (MR scans, landmarks and surface maps for deep subcortical structures, and FreeSurfer cortical parcellation and measurement data), cognitive (cognitive domain scores for crystallized intelligence, working memory, episodic memory, and executive function), clinical (demographic, sibling relationship, SAPS and SANS psychopathology), and genetic (20 polymorphisms) data, collected from more than 450 subjects, most with 2-year longitudinal follow-up. A neuroimaging mapping, analysis and visualization software tool, CAWorks, is also part of this resource. Moreover, in making our existing neuroimaging data along with the associated meta-data and computational tools publically accessible, we have established a web-based information retrieval portal that allows the user to efficiently search the collection. This research-ready dataset meaningfully combines neuroimaging data with other relevant information, and it can be used to help facilitate advancing neuroimaging research. It is our hope that this effort will help to overcome some of the commonly recognized technical barriers in advancing neuroimaging research such as lack of local organization and standard descriptions.},

The findings indicate that only 5.2{\%} of the referrals were for the problem of alcohol. Furthermore, the detection rate of an alcohol problem by both the referring physicians and the psychiatric consultants was low (8.3{\%}) as compared with the literature's reported prevalence rate of alcoholism in the general hospital (8.7{\%}-55{\%}). The problem of recognition of an alcohol problem in the medical/surgical patient is explored with particular emphasis on the obstacles to diagnosis--masking of alcoholism by other major psychiatric disease, the categorization of patients by symptom rather than underlying causation, and the lack of sufficient employment of useful diagnostic screening devices.},

@article{Rathier2011,
abstract = {Treatment of acute illness in older adults is frequently complicated by the presence of delirium. Delirium is characterized by the development of an altered mental status over the course of hours to days, and can have a fluctuating course. Patients with delirium have difficulty paying attention to their environment, have disorganized thinking, and usually have an altered level of consciousness. While scientists continue to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with delirium, clinicians can identify patients at risk for delirium and diagnose it using valid instruments, such as the Confusion Assessment Method and Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Delirium is an independent risk factor for death, institutionalization, and dementia, and resolves in many patients by the time of hospital discharge. For patients admitted to medical units, optimal management of delirium includes reassessment of medications, pain, sleep, nutrition, mobility, need for physical restraints, and bowel and bladder function. The use of antipsychotic medication to sedate delirious patients should be restricted to patients in danger of harming themselves or others and should be used when nonpharmacologic means fail. Multicomponent interventions performed by the hospital care team that address risk factors can prevent delirium in patients in medical units and those undergoing hip fracture repair. This includes attention to the depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia and the addition of regional nerve blocks to patient-controlled analgesia in orthopedic patients, both of which may reduce postoperative delirium. Perioperative use of antipsychotics may further reduce the incidence of delirium, although hospital length of stay has not been routinely reduced. Appropriate management of analgesia, sedation, and delirium in the intensive care unit is also associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, as well as intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. The use of dexmedetomidine, an $\alpha$-adrenergic receptor agonist, for sedation may reduce intensive care unit length of stay when compared with use of benzodiazepines.},

In this respect, current research increasingly emphasizes the importance of deficits in facial expression recognition. The focus of the present study is the performance in recognizing 6 basic emotions (sadness, anger, happiness, fear, disgust, surprise) which play an essential role in shaping daily function and interpersonal interactions. A group of 20 patients diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia were compared with a group of 20 matched controls on a facial expression recognition task, derived from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (Lundqvist D, Flykt A, Ohmann A (1998) The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF). Stockholm (Sweden): Karolinska Institute), and were subsequently assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Facial expression recognition performance was significantly more impaired in patients, and was selectively correlated with the positive and cognitive dimensions of the positive and negative syndrome scale. Furthermore, significant group differences were found with respect to happiness and surprise.},

abstract = {Successful treatment of first-episode psychosis is one of the major factors that impacts long-term prognosis. Currently, there are no satisfactory biological markers (biomarkers) to predict which patients with a first-episode psychosis will respond to which treatment. In addition, a non-negligible rate of patients does not respond to any treatment or may develop side effects that affect adherence to the treatments as well as negatively impact physical health. Thus, there clearly is a pressing need for defining biomarkers that may be helpful to predict response to treatment and sensitivity to side effects in first-episode psychosis. The present systematic review provides (1) trials that assessed biological markers associated with antipsychotic response or side effects in first-episode psychosis and (2) potential biomarkers associated with biological disturbances that may guide the choice of conventional treatments or the prescription of innovative treatments. Trials including first-episode psychoses are few in number. Most of the available data focused on pharmacogenetics markers with so far only preliminary results. To date, these studies yielded-beside markers for metabolism of antipsychotics-no or only a few biomarkers for response or side effects, none of which have been implemented in daily clinical practice. Other biomarkers exploring immunoinflammatory, oxidative, and hormonal disturbances emerged as biomarkers of first-episode psychoses in the last decades, and some of them have been associated with treatment response. In addition to pharmacogenetics, further efforts should focus on the association of emergent biomarkers with conventional treatments or with innovative therapies efficacy, where some preliminary data suggest promising results.},

This may reflect variation in methodology, and the use of small samples with differing illness duration and medication exposure. AIMS: To determine the extent and location of white matter microstructural changes in schizophrenia, using optimised diffusion tensor imaging in a large patient sample, and to consider the effects of illness duration and medication exposure. METHOD: Scans from 76 patients with schizophrenia and 76 matched controls were used to compare fractional anisotropy, a measure of white matter microstructural integrity, between the groups. RESULTS: We found widespread clusters of reduced fractional anisotropy in patients, affecting most major white matter tracts. These reductions did not correlate with illness duration, and there was no difference between age-matched chronically and briefly medicated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of widespread fractional anisotropy reductions in our larger sample of patients with schizophrenia may explain some of the inconsistent findings of previous, smaller studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although intellectual and neurocognitive deficits accompany schizophrenia, there are inconsistencies in the literature concerning issues of intellectual decline, premorbid deficits, a modal deficit pattern, and preserved abilities. METHODS: A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered once to 117 consecutively admitted patients with chronic schizophrenia and a group of 27 healthy control subjects to examine patterns of premorbid and current intellect (measured by means of reading scores and IQ, respectively) and the attendant cognitive profiles in schizophrenia using classification methods based on clinically derived (IQ levels) and atheoretical (cluster) techniques. RESULTS: Sixty patients (51{\%}) with schizophrenia who displayed a general intellectual decline of 10 points or greater from estimated premorbid levels also exhibited deficits of executive function, memory, and attention. Twenty-eight patients (23{\%}) with consistently low estimated premorbid intellect and current intellectual levels who displayed no evidence of IQ decline exhibited language and visual processing deficits in addition to deficits present in the intellectually declining group. The remaining 29 patients (25{\%}) who displayed average estimated premorbid intellectual levels did not show IQ decline and exhibited a cognitive profile similar to normal, with the exception of executive function and attention impairment. Atheoretical analyses support the findings from clinically derived subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IQ decline, although modal in schizophrenia, is not universally characteristic and that executive function and attention deficits may be core features of schizophrenia, independent of IQ variations.},

abstract = {When investigating treatments for any chronic condition it is essential to know the usual course of the illness concerned. The natural history of bipolar affective disorder has only been established relatively recently. This review examines the factors that affect the course of bipolar disorder from an historical perspective. These include the affective nature of the episodes and the influence of psychotic symptoms, age at onset of illness, length of episodes and cycles, gender, ethnicity, concurrent drug and alcohol use, occupational status and factors leading to chronicity. The pioneering work of Kraepelin and Angst established that episodes of illness in bipolar disorder increased in frequency over time and that earlier age of onset predicted more frequent episodes. More recent work has established that female subjects have a later onset of illness, that the frequency of episodes often decreases over time and that rapid cycling has a poorer response to treatment. Suggested criteria for inclusion of subjects into trials examining manic relapse are listed based on the findings from earlier work.},

abstract = {Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new neuroimaging technique that can be used to examine the microstructure of white matter in vivo. A systematic review of DTI studies in schizophrenia was undertaken to test the hypothesis that DTI can detect white matter differences between schizophrenia patients and normal control subjects. Methods: EMBASE, PubMed, Medline, and PsychInfo were searched online and key journals were searched manually for studies comparing anisotropy (a measure of white matter integrity) between patients and control subjects. Nineteen articles were systematically reviewed. Results: Though 16 studies found differences, methodological and data differences prevented a meta-analysis. Fourteen studies found reduced anisotropy in patients; two studies found only a loss of normal asymmetry. The region of investigation varied across studies, however, and when the same region (for example, the cingulum) was examined in different studies, as many failed to find a difference as found one. These inconsistencies may be the result of small sample sizes and differences in methodology. Conclusions: Diffusion tensor imaging has yet to provide consistent findings of white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia. Its potential as a means of examining anatomical connectivity may be realized with the study of larger, more homogenous groups of subjects and with ongoing improvements in image analysis. ?? 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {A major reconceptualization of personality psychopathology has been proposed for DSM-5 that identifies core impairments in personality functioning, pathological personality traits, and prominent pathological personality types. A comprehensive personality assessment consists of four components: levels of personality functioning, personality disorder types, pathological personality trait domains and facets, and general criteria for personality disorder. This four-part assessment focuses attention on identifying personality psychopathology with increasing degrees of specificity, based on a clinician's available time, information, and expertise. In Part I of this two-part article, we describe the components of the new model and present brief theoretical and empirical rationales for each. In Part II, we will illustrate the clinical application of the model with vignettes of patients with varying degrees of personality psychopathology, to show how assessments might be conducted and diagnoses reached.},

abstract = {Depression is prevalent in the elderly and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis can be complicated by the presence of concomitant medical and/or psychiatric disorders, and it is important to exclude a number of factors, such as neurological disease, hormonal causes, chronic illness, or substance abuse, particularly alcohol. Although comorbid medical illness may contribute to depressive illness, depressive disorders are not a consequence of aging. Most classes of antidepressants that are effective in adult patients are effective in the elderly and, in general, they have shown comparable efficacy in terms of response rates. However, antidepressants vary in terms of their tolerability profiles, and treatment of the elderly is complicated by their sensitivity to medication side effects and the potential for serious adverse events, such as falling or delirium. A correct dosing strategy is particularly important for the elderly, whose treatment should usually start at low doses of antidepressants and increase slowly. It is possible to successfully treat elderly patients with depressive disorder, and antidepressant therapy should be selected on the basis of prior response to treatment, the adverse-event profile, and the potential for drug-drug interactions. Treatment should also take into account the likelihood of achieving and maintaining remission of symptoms in order to restore the patient to a baseline level of functioning appropriate for their age.},

abstract = {Molecular imaging with ictal and interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as well as positron emission tomography (PET) rank among the established functional imaging tests for the presurgical evaluation of epileptic onset zone in patients with intractable partial epilepsy. In temporal lobe epilepsy the sensitivity of these methods was shown to be excellent, in particular if a multimodal platform is used, which combines the functional imaging with the additional morphological information of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but was lower in extra temporal lobe epilepsy. Functional imaging with SPECT and PET reflects seizure related changes of cerebral perfusion, glucose-metabolism and neuroreceptor status. In this review the usefulness of SPECT and PET imaging in clinical routine in epilepsy as well as the role of different neuroreceptor PET-tracer, which were used in epilepsy are discussed. The use of perfusion SPECT tracer allows the investigation of ictal activations, but the low temporal resolution of ictal perfusion SPECT often results in the detection of both the ictal onset zone as well as the propagation pathways, an area that has not always need to be resected in order to render a patient seizure free. The additional use of interictal PET with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose which measures regional cerebral metabolism or interictal perfusion SPECT enhance the informational value of ictal SPECT and were shown to be important tools to better define the ictal onset and surround inhibition zones. In recent years PET imaging of different cerebral neuroreceptor-systems inter alia GABAA receptors, serotonin receptors (5-HT1A), opioid receptors as well as dopamine receptors was used to investigate the neurochemical basis of epilepsy, the role of these neurotransmitters for the epileptogenesis as well as the spread of epileptic activity during seizures and partially entered in clinical routine. Currently some of these radioligands are also used to investigate new treatment approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent hypothesis is that suicidality in schizophrenia may be linked to the patients' altered basic self-awareness or sense of self, termed self-disorders (SDs). AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate whether SDs in first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders are related to suicidality and whether this relationship is independent of or mediated by depression or other standard clinical measures. METHOD: Self-disorders were assessed in 49 patients with first-episode schizophrenia by means of the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE) instrument. Symptoms severity and functioning were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, and Global Assessment of Functioning-Split Version. Suicidality was measured by the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia item 8. RESULTS: Analyses detected a significant association between current suicidality, current depression, and SDs as measured by the EASE. The effect of SDs on suicidal ideation appeared to be mediated by depression. CONCLUSION: The interaction between anomalous self-experiences and depression could be a rational clinical target for the prevention of suicidality in the early phases of schizophrenia and supports the rationale for including assessment of SDs in early intervention efforts.},

abstract = {This double-blind, randomized, multicenter study investigated the use of divalproex with an antipsychotic agent in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Patients (n = 249) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine monotherapy, risperidone monotherapy, divalproex plus olanzapine, or divalproex plus risperidone for 28 days. Divalproex was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day and titrated over 12 days to a maximum dosage of 30 mg/kg/day. Olanzapine and risperidone, were, respectively, initiated at 5 and 2 mg/day and were titrated over the first 6 days to respective target fixed daily dosages of 15 and 6 mg/day. Improvements from baseline were observed at all evaluation points throughout the 28-day treatment period in the two combination therapy and the two antipsychotic monotherapy groups, with statistically significant treatment differences favoring combination therapy as soon as day 3 for Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRSd) total score, as well as PANSS and BPRSd subscales. These findings were confirmed in post hoc repeated-measures analyses of variance in which treatment differences favoring combination therapy were observed for PANSS total (p = 0.020) and PANSS positive scale scores (p = 0.002). Both combination therapy and antipsychotic monotherapy were well tolerated. Treatment with divalproex in combination with an atypical antipsychotic agent resulted in earlier improvements in a range of psychotic symptoms among acutely hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Further evaluation is warranted to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {Despite practice guidelines recommending caregiver inclusion for assessment of mental health problems in adolescents, clinical high-risk (CHR) assessment tools that target attenuated psychosis symptoms rely solely on self-report. As many individuals in the clinical high-risk phase are expected to be adolescents, and programs of CHR research routinely recruit participants as young as twelve, parent input regarding adolescents' symptoms and functioning may help to inform clinical conceptualizations. No assessment tool targeting CHR symptoms has been developed for this purpose. We created a caregiver-report version of the 12-item Prime Screen-Revised and administered the measure to caregivers of 52 youth ages 12-19 referred by mental health providers for CHR study participation. Youth completed the Prime Screen-Revised as well as the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes (SIPS). Caregiver responses demonstrated poor agreement with youth ratings on Prime Screen-Revised (r= .09), but moderate agreement with clinician ratings (r= .41). The addition of caregiver screening data to youth self-report scores significantly improved a linear regression predicting clinician ratings. Using a threshold of four or more endorsements, the combined use of parent and adolescent responses accurately classified 75{\{}{\%}{\}} of respondents with regard to SIPS-determined CHR status. Findings suggest that involving caregivers may help to improve the specificity of CHR screening and assessment procedures. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide a practical overview of the pharmacological management of adults with bipolar disorder in primary care and the role of general practitioners in the pharmacotherapy of this complex disorder. DATA SOURCES: Published guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder, plus Cochrane reviews, meta-analyses, review articles and reports from randomised controlled trials that were published up to May 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Over 500 articles on the treatment of bipolar disorder were reviewed, with an emphasis on meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials. Where evidence was more limited, open trials and non-controlled data were also reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Key recommendations relevant to GPs were synthesised and rated according to National Health and Medical Research Council levels of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lithium, valproate and atypical antipsychotics are first-line treatment options for acute mania, and monotherapy is ideal if it produces an adequate response. For depressive episodes, recommendations are less definitive and the use of antidepressants is controversial. Most patients require maintenance treatment, during which pharmacotherapy should be used to prevent relapse, and psychological and social interventions should be considered. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar disorder is a lifelong episodic illness that affects 1{\{}{\%}{\}}-2{\{}{\%}{\}} of the population, many of whom are principally managed by their GPs. Pharmacological treatment with mood-stabilising agents is the primary form of management, although this is ideally provided in conjunction with psychosocial interventions.},

abstract = {Explanatory models in psychiatry reflect what clinicians deem valuable in rendering people's behavior intelligible and thus help guide treatment choices for mental illnesses. This article outlines some key scientific and ethical principles of clinical explanation in twenty-first century psychiatry. Recent work in philosophy of science, clinical psychiatry, and psychiatric ethics are critically reviewed in order to elucidate conceptual underpinnings of contemporary explanatory models. Many explanatory models in psychiatry are reductionistic or eclectic. The former restrict options for diagnostic and therapeutic paradigm choice, while the latter lack a well-defined theoretical basis. These two methodological approaches stand in a dialectical relation to one another insofar as clinicians often move from one approach to its antithesis, ultimately seeking a synthesis of the two approaches that satisfies clinical needs. Pragmatic considerations can help to transcend the reductionism/eclecticism dialectic. In the absence of a completed science of mental disorders, psychiatrists must tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty as they strive to integrate diverse explanatory concepts in a rigorous and evidence-based fashion. A pragmatic explanatory model in clinical psychiatry must focus on favorable treatment outcomes for patients by respecting the pluralistic, participatory, and provisional nature of psychiatric explanation.},

abstract = {Brazil has been experiencing a steady increase in the elderly population during the past few years, and as a result old age health-related problems are increasing continuously in number. Psychiatric symptoms are among the most prevalent health problems of the elderly and are an important source of distress for patients and carers, being also associated with significant growth in the costs and demand for the provision of health care services. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems among the elderly attending a regional primary care unit in the city of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. A total of 351 patients older than 60 were assessed during a 6-month period with the SRQ-20 (a scale for the detection of minor psychiatric problems), four questions on psychotic symptoms. AMTS (a scale for the assessment of cognitive functioning) and CAGE (a scale for the assessment of alcoholism); demographic variables were also recorded. Subjects' mean age was 71.22 (CI = 70.51-71.92) and 83.5{\%} were female. Thirty-two per cent of subjects were considered 'cases' as they scored more than 7 on the SRQ-20 (26.8{\%} of total), or more than 1 on the CAGE (1.4{\%} of total), or at least 1 on the questions assessing psychotic symptoms (12.2{\%} of total). There was a significant excess of women among those found to suffer from psychiatric problems (90.1{\%} vs 80.4{\%}). Cases were also more likely to be illiterate (23.4{\%} vs 12.1{\%}) and to have a lower income (2.21 vs 4.01 minimum wages). Depressive symptoms and tension were highly prevalent (72.9{\%} of subjects). Somatic complaints and signs of inefficient functioning were also common (50.4{\%} and 45.9{\%} respectively). Only five patients answered affirmatively two or more CAGE questions and 12.2{\%} scored at least 1 on the questions assessing psychotic symptoms. Cognitive deficit, as determined by the AMTS, was observed in 13.4{\%} of the sample and was associated with ageing, being illiterate and having higher total SRQ-20 scores. We suggest, that the organization of health care services should take into account the needs of this population, and should also emphasize professional training for the correct assessment and treatment of the most frequent mental health problems in old age.},

abstract = {Macaque monkeys were shown retinotopically-specific visual stimuli during 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) infusion in a study of the retinotopic organization of primary visual cortex (V1). In the central half of V1, the cortical magnification was found to be greater along the vertical than along the horizontal meridian, and overall magnification factors appeared to be scaled proportionate to brain size across different species. The cortical magnification factor (CMF) was found to reach a maximum of about 15 mm/deg at the representation of the fovea, at a point of acute curvature in the V1-V2 border. We find neither a duplication nor an overrepresentation of the vertical meridian. The magnification factor did not appear to be doubled in a direction perpendicular to the ocular dominance strips; it may not be increased at all. The DG borders in parvorecipient layer 4Cb were found to be as sharp as 140 micron (half-amplitude, half width), corresponding to a visual angle of less than 2' of arc at the eccentricity measured. In other layers (including magnorecipient layer 4Ca), the retinotopic borders are broader. The retinotopic spread of activity is greater when produced by a low-spatial-frequency grating than when produced by a high-spatial-frequency grating. Orientation-specific stimuli produced a pattern of activation that spread further than 1 mm across cortex in some layers. Some DG evidence suggests that the spread of functional activity is greater near the foveal representation than near 5 degrees eccentricity.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates representation of clinical consequences of developmental psychological trauma in the current proposal of DSM-5. Despite intensive efforts by its proponents for two decades, it is not known yet if Complex PTSD will take a place in the final version of DSM-5. Recognition of dissociative character of several symptom dimensions and introduction of items about negative affects such as shame and guilt imply an indirect improvement toward better coverage of the consequences of developmental trauma in the existing category of PTSD. As disorders with highest prevalence of chronic traumatization in early years of life, dissociative disorders and personality disorder of borderline type are maintained as DSM-5 categories; however, recognition of a separate type of trauma-related personality disorder is unlikely. While a preschooler age variant of PTSD is under consideration, the proposed diagnosis of Developmental Trauma Disorder (child version of Complex PTSD) has not secured a place in the DSM-5 yet. We welcome considerations of subsuming Adjustment Disorders, Acute Stress Disorder, PTSD, and Dissociative Disorders under one rubric, i.e., Section of Trauma, Stress, or Event Related Disorders. Given the current conceptualization of DSM-5, this paper proposes Complex PTSD to be a subtype of the DSM-5 PTSD. Composition of a traumarelated disorders section would facilitate integration of knowledge and expertise about interrelated and overlapping consequences of trauma.

A meta-analysis of risk factors reveals associations with developmental stage, child and adult social adversity, psychoactive drug use, and also male sex and migrant status. The small difference between prevalence and incidence rates, together with data from follow-up studies, indicates that approximately 75-90{\%} of developmental psychotic experiences are transitory and disappear over time. There is evidence, however, that transitory developmental expression of psychosis (psychosis proneness) may become abnormally persistent (persistence) and subsequently clinically relevant (impairment), depending on the degree of environmental risk the person is additionally exposed to. The psychosis proneness-persistence-impairment model considers genetic background factors impacting on a broadly distributed and transitory population expression of psychosis during development, poor prognosis of which, in terms of persistence and clinical need, is predicted by environmental exposure interacting with genetic risk.},

abstract = {The hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) system plays a central role in the regulation of various functions, including sleep/wake regulation and metabolism. There is a growing interest in hypocretin function in Parkinson's disease (PD), given the high prevalence of non-motor symptoms such as sleep disturbances in this disorder. However, studies measuring CSF hypocretin levels have yielded contradictory results. In PD patients and matched controls, we (i) estimated the number of hypocretin neurons in post-mortem hypothalami using immunocytochemistry and an image analysis system (ii) quantified hypocretin levels in post-mortem ventricular CSF and (iii) prefrontal cortex using a radioimmunoassay. Furthermore, presence of Lewy bodies was verified in the hypothalamic hypocretin cell area. Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile). We showed a significant decrease between PD patients and controls in (i) the number of hypocretin neurons (PD: 20 276 (13 821-31 229); controls: 36 842 (32 546-50 938); P = 0.016); (ii) the hypocretin-1 concentration in post-mortem ventricular CSF (PD: 365.5 pg/ml (328.0-448.3); controls: 483.5 (433.5-512.3); P = 0.012) and (iii) the hypocretin-1 concentrations in prefrontal cortex (PD: 389.6 pg/g (249.2-652.2); controls: 676.6 (467.5-883.9); P = 0.043). Hypocretin neurotransmission is affected in PD. The hypocretin-1 concentration in the prefrontal cortex was almost 40{\%} lower in PD patients, while ventricular CSF levels were almost 25{\%} reduced. The total number of hypocretin neurons was almost half compared to controls.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuroanatomical abnormalities are a well-established feature of schizophrenia. However, the timing of their emergence and the extent to which they are related to vulnerability to the disorder as opposed to psychotic illness itself is unclear. AIMS: To assess regional grey matter volume in the at-risk individuals who subsequently developed psychosis. METHOD: Magnetic resonance imaging data from at-risk individuals who developed psychosis (n=12) within the following 25 months were compared with data from healthy volunteers (n=22) and people with first-episode psychosis (n=25). RESULTS: Compared with healthy volunteers, individuals who subsequently developed psychosis had smaller grey matter volume in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and paracentral lobule bilaterally and in the left superior parietal lobule, and greater grey matter volume in a left parietal/posterior temporal region. Compared with first-episode patients, they had relatively greater grey matter volume in the temporal gyrus bilaterally and smaller grey matter volume in the right lentiform nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the structural brain abnormalities in individuals with an at-risk mental state may be related to an increased vulnerability to psychosis, while others are associated with the development of a psychotic illness.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epileptic disorder with characteristic electroclinical features but diverse etiologies. The shared electroclinical characteristics suggest that common cerebral networks are involved in generating seizures. We sought to reveal these networks by comparing ictal and interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We identified 10 ictal-interictal SPECT pairs from seven patients with LGS (median age 11 years; range 1-38) who were studied during video electroencephalography (EEG)-confirmed tonic seizures. We performed a voxel-wise comparison of ictal and interictal SPECT studies across the group. The evolution of blood flow changes was explored by examining early and late injection groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY FINDINGS: Median duration of tonic seizures was 10 s (range 6-29 s), and injection latency from seizure offset was -8 to 48 s. In the early injection group ({\textless}10 s; three studies), there was hyperperfusion over pons and cerebellar hemispheres (p {\textless} 0.05 cluster corrected family wise error), and hypoperfusion bilaterally over the pericentral region, with a trend toward hyperperfusion over bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri, and lateral parietal cortex. In the late injection group, there was hyperperfusion over midline and lateral cerebellar regions, with hypoperfusion widely over bilateral frontal regions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that the tonic seizures of LGS result from activity in a network, containing bilateral frontal and parietal association areas and the pons. We postulate that tonic seizures recruit the corticoreticular system, which connects frontal attentional areas to the pontine reticular formation, and is normally responsible for postural tone and orienting behavior.},

abstract = {Emil Kraepelin fundamentally shaped our current psychiatric nosology. Although much has been written about his diagnostic formulations, less is known about his views on the fundamental nature of psychiatric illness and the goals of psychiatric nosology. We focus on his writings from 1896 to 1903 but also review his inaugural lecture in Dorpat in 1887 and his last two papers, published in 1919-1920. Kraepelin hoped for a 'natural' classification of psychiatric illness but realized that the level of etiologic knowledge required to undergird this effort was not feasible in his own lifetime. This did not stop him, however, from developing a pragmatic approach based on his clinical method of careful description with detailed follow-up, coupled with the available fallible tools of pathological anatomy and, by 1919, genetics and biochemistry. Kraepelin saw psychiatric disorders as multifactorial, arising from the difficult to untangle action and interaction of internal and external causes. He was aware of the problem of defining the boundaries of illness and health but knew this was not unique to psychiatry. Contrary to his stereotype, he was sensitive to the importance of personality factors in psychiatric illness and advocated for their investigation. He also recognized the limitations of his 'clinical method' and was especially critical of classifications based on single prominent symptoms. Ultimately, Kraepelin was a skeptical realist when it came to psychiatric nosology. His goal of developing a consistent 'natural' classification of the major mental disorders has yet to be attained, but his 'research agenda' remains central to psychiatry to the present day.},

Because of the influence of major research studies such as the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia and the U.S./U.K. study, emphasis has been placed on developing reliable descriptions of symptoms and a precise definition of the disorder. This research also led to a recognition that the American concept of schizophrenia was relatively broad in comparison with that used in the rest of the world. This led to a critical reappraisal of American diagnostic practices during the 1970's, culminating in the narrower definition of schizophrenia in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-III). This definition requires the presence of psychotic features, established chronicity, evidence of deterioration, and the exclusion of affective and "organic" features. In comparison with this definition, the Soviet concept appears to be much broader and to include non-psychotic forms. Treatment implications of these differences are discussed.},

Our results provide neuroanatomical insights into the mechanism by which sex steroid hormones mediate their central effects and raise the intriguing possibility that specific regions of the neuroendocrine brain use ovarian cycle-dependent plasticity to control reproduction in humans. These MRI-based physiological studies may pave the way for the development of new diagnostic and treatment strategies in the central loss of reproductive competence in human syndromes, such as hypothalamic amenorrhea.},

abstract = {The human brain is a complex network. An important first step toward understanding the function of such a network is to map its elements and connections, to create a comprehensive structural description of the network architecture. This paper reviews current empirical efforts toward generating a network map of the human brain, the human connectome, and explores how the connectome can provide new insights into the organization of the brain's structural connections and their role in shaping functional dynamics. Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small-world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear. Future studies of the human connectome will greatly expand our knowledge of network topology and dynamics in the healthy, developing, aging, and diseased brain.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate differences in characteristics of burn patients who had attempted suicide, as compared with other burn patients admitted to the Helsinki Burn Centre during 1989-97. Burn patients were first drawn from a computerised register, after which a psychiatrist examined their medical records and ascertained the suicide attempters. Of the total of 811 burn patients, 46 (5.7{\%}) had attempted suicide. The median total body surface area (TBSA) of suicide attempters (24.0{\%}) was markedly higher than in the other patients (6.0{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Flame was a much more common cause of burns among suicide attempters (82.1{\%}) than among the remainder (44.5{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Suicide attempters were also more often unemployed (28.2 versus 12.9{\%}) or on disability pension (30.8 versus 7.1{\%}) before the injury (P {\textless} 0.001). Although the proportion with self-inflicted burns among all burn patients was not high, the markedly higher severity of their burns makes them an important clinical subgroup for further study.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A prominent view in the neuropsychological literature is that schizophrenia is particularly associated with executive dysfunction, yet in a meta-analytic review it was concluded that, relative to their general level of intellectual functioning, schizophrenics are not disproportionately impaired on a measure of this construct, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). However, verbal fluency tests may be more valid measures of executive functioning as they are more sensitive to the presence of focal frontal lobe injuries. METHOD: A meta-analysis was conducted on 84 studies comparing the performance of schizophrenics and healthy controls on tests of phonemic and semantic fluency, as well as other cognitive measures presumed to impose only minimal demands on executive functioning. RESULTS: Neither phonemic or semantic fluency deficits qualified as differential deficits relative to general intelligence or psychomotor speed. Patients with schizophrenia were significantly more impaired on semantic relative to phonemic fluency. CONCLUSIONS: As for the WCST, deficits on tests of verbal fluency reflect a more generalised intellectual impairment and not particular difficulties with executive control processes. The larger deficit for semantic relative to phonemic fluency suggests that, in addition to general retrieval difficulties, schizophrenia is associated with compromises to the semantic store.},

abstract = {Seizures are associated with an increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In partial seizures the increased blood flow closely corresponds with the site of seizure origin. Using tracers that accumulate and remain "fixed" in different areas of the brain proportional to rCBF at the time of injection, ictal SPECT is now an important tool for localization of seizures in a presurgical evaluation. However, the best methods for interpretation of partial seizure-induced changes in rCBF remain unclear. Numerous computer-aided tools have been used to increase objectivity and accuracy of ictal SPECT analysis. This review examines the uses of ictal-interictal subtraction methods and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to enhance interpretation and utility of ictal SPECT. The review covers the evolution of advanced ictal SPECT imaging analysis techniques and the authors' clinical experience with the use of subtraction and SPM methods. The authors discuss the impact of ictal SPECT subtraction or difference imaging methods and the initial evidence for proof-of-principle that SPM can be used to provide objective, accurate analysis of ictal SPECT scans in patients with temporal and extratemporal lobe epilepsy. The limitations of both methodologies are discussed, and suggestions for further study of validation, improvement, and routine clinical implementation of advanced analysis methods are provided.},

abstract = {Background: Significant neuropsychological (NP) and functional deficits are found in most schizophrenia patients. Previous studies have left questions as to whether global NP impairment or discrete domains affect functional outcomes, and none have addressed distinctions within and between ability and performance domains. This study examined the different predictive relationships between NP domains, functional competence, social competence, symptoms, and real-world behavior in domains of work skills, interpersonal relationships, and community activities. Methods: Two hundred twenty-two schizophrenic outpatients were tested with an NP battery and performance-based measures of functional and social competence and rated for positive, negative, and depressive symptoms. Case managers generated ratings of three functional disability domains. Results: Four cognitive factors were derived from factor analysis. Path analyses revealed both direct and mediated effects of NP on real-world outcomes. All NP domains predicted functional competence, but only processing speed and attention/working memory predicted social competence. Both competence measures mediated the effects of NP on community activities and work skills, but only social competence predicted interpersonal behaviors. The attention/working memory domain was directly related to work skills, executive functions had a direct effect on interpersonal behaviors, and processing speed had direct effects on all three real-world behaviors. Symptoms were directly related to outcomes, with fewer relationships with competence. Conclusions: Differential predictors of functional competence and performance were found from discrete NP domains. Separating competence and performance provides a more precise perspective on correlates of disability. Changes in specific NP or functional skills might improve specific outcomes, rather than promoting global functional improvement. ?? 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

@article{Batty2007,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Studies of middle-aged and particularly older-aged adults found that those with higher scores on tests of IQ (cognitive function) had lower rates of later mortality. Interpretation of such findings potentially is hampered by the problem of reverse causality: such somatic diseases as diabetes or hypertension, common in older adults, can decrease cognitive function. Studies that provide extended follow-up of the health experience of individuals who had their (premorbid) IQ assessed in childhood and/or early adulthood minimize this concern. The purpose of the present report is to systematically locate, evaluate, and interpret the findings of all such studies.

METHODS: We systematically identified individual-level studies linking premorbid IQ with later mortality by using four approaches: search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCHINFO); scrutiny of the reference sections of identified reports; search of our own files; and contact with researchers in the field. Study quality was assessed by using predefined criteria.

RESULTS: Nine cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, study quality was moderate. All reports showed an inverse IQ-mortality relation; i.e., higher IQ scores were associated with decreased mortality risk. The nature of this relation (i.e., dose-response or threshold) and whether it differs by sex was unclear. The IQ-mortality association did not appear to be explained by reverse causality or selection bias. Confounding by other early-life factors also did not seem to explain the association, although some studies were not well characterized in this regard. Adult socioeconomic position appeared to mediate the IQ-mortality association in some studies, but this was not a universal finding.

CONCLUSIONS: In all studies, higher IQ in the first two decades of life was related to lower rates of total mortality in middle to late adulthood. Some plausible mechanistic pathways exist, but further examination is required. The precise nature of the IQ-mortality relation (particularly in ethnic minorities and women) and the link between IQ and disease-specific outcomes also warrants further research.},

@article{Kendler2011,
abstract = {This essay explores four answers to the question 'What kinds of things are psychiatric disorders?' Essentialist kinds are classes whose members share an essence from which their defining features arise. Although elegant and appropriate for some physical (e.g. atomic elements) and medical (e.g. Mendelian disorders) phenomena, this model is inappropriate for psychiatric disorders, which are multi-factorial and 'fuzzy'. Socially constructed kinds are classes whose members are defined by the cultural context in which they arise. This model excludes the importance of shared physiological mechanisms by which the same disorder could be identified across different cultures. Advocates of practical kinds put off metaphysical questions about 'reality' and focus on defining classes that are useful. Practical kinds models for psychiatric disorders, implicit in the DSM nosologies, do not require that diagnoses be grounded in shared causal processes. If psychiatry seeks to tie disorders to etiology and underlying mechanisms, a model first proposed for biological species, mechanistic property cluster (MPC) kinds, can provide a useful framework. MPC kinds are defined not in terms of essences but in terms of complex, mutually reinforcing networks of causal mechanisms. We argue that psychiatric disorders are objectively grounded features of the causal structure of the mind/brain. MPC kinds are fuzzy sets defined by mechanisms at multiple levels that act and interact to produce the key features of the kind. Like species, psychiatric disorders are populations with central paradigmatic and more marginal members. The MPC view is the best current answer to 'What kinds of things are psychiatric disorders?'},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To investigate the validity of the NART as an estimate of premorbid IQ in schizophrenia. DESIGN A within-in participants, follow-back design was adopted. METHODS A sample of adults with schizophrenia who had presented to psychiatric services and had a measure of IQ routinely taken during childhood were traced and subject to follow-up WAIS-R and NART IQ assessment (N = 24). Measures of current IQ and NART estimated premorbid IQ were compared with the measure of IQ taken 'premorbidly', i.e. in childhood. RESULTS There were no significant differences between childhood and adult measures of IQ. However there were significant differences between these two indices and NART estimated IQ, particularly where IQ deviated from general population means. The Vocabulary subtest of the WAIS-R performed better as an estimate of both premorbid and current IQ in the sample. CONCLUSION Use of a word-reading test such as the NART to predict past levels of intellectual function should proceed with caution, particularly where IQ does not fall in the 'average' category. Use of more than one index of prior level of function is recommended.},

Krueger and Nicholas R. Eaton (see record 2010-13810-003). This article develops the larger theme that the fundamental quantitatively developed architecture of personality provides a sound base for classifying all areas of psychopathology and, more specifically, should underlie the current effort to revise the classification of personality disorders (PDs) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). My commentary is organized around what I perceive to be four significant problems with the proposed change to a trait-based system: (1) unfamiliarity to clinicians (and possibly unfeasibility), (2) lack of clinical utility, (3) the preliminary quality of the science upon which the proposed change is based, and (4) harmful effects on the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD).

abstract = {Prospective, multiyear epidemiologic studies have proven to be highly effective in discovering preventable risk factors for chronic disease. Investigations such as the Framingham Heart Study have produced blueprints for disease prevention and saved millions of lives and billions of dollars. To discover preventable environmental risk factors for disease in children, the US Congress directed the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, through the Children's Health Act of 2000, to conduct the National Children's Study. The National Children's Study is hypothesis-driven and will seek information on environmental risks and individual susceptibility factors for asthma, birth defects, dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, schizophrenia, and obesity, as well as for adverse birth outcomes. It will be conducted in a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 100,000 US-born children. Children will be followed from conception to 21 years of age. Environmental exposures (chemical, physical, biological, and psychosocial) will be assessed repeatedly during pregnancy and throughout childhood in children's homes, schools, and communities. Chemical assays will be performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and banks of biological and environmental samples will be established for future analyses. Genetic material will be collected on each mother and child and banked to permit study of gene-environment interactions. Recruitment is scheduled to begin in 2007 at 7 Vanguard Sites and will extend to 105 sites across the United States. The National Children's Study will generate multiple satellite studies that explore methodologic issues, etiologic questions, and potential interventions. It will provide training for the next generation of researchers and practitioners in environmental pediatrics and will link to planned and ongoing prospective birth cohort studies in other nations. Data from the National Children's Study will guide development of a comprehensive blueprint for disease prevention in children.},

abstract = {In vivo MRI-derived measurements of human cerebral cortex thickness are providing novel insights into normal and abnormal neuroanatomy, but little is known about their reliability. We investigated how the reliability of cortical thickness measurements is affected by MRI instrument-related factors, including scanner field strength, manufacturer, upgrade and pulse sequence. Several data processing factors were also studied. Two test -retest data sets were analyzed: 1) 15 healthy older subjects scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three scanners; 2) 5 subjects scanned before and after a major scanner upgrade. Within-scanner variability of global cortical thickness measurements was {\textless}0.03 mm, and the point-wise standard deviation of measurement error was approximately 0.12 mm. Variability was 0.15 mm and 0.17 mm in average, respectively, for cross-scanner (Siemens/GE) and cross-field strength (1.5 T/3 T) comparisons. Scanner upgrade did not increase variability nor introduce bias. Measurements across field strength, however, were slightly biased (thicker at 3 T). The number of (single vs. multiple averaged) acquisitions had a negligible effect on reliability, but the use of a different pulse sequence had a larger impact, as did different parameters employed in data processing. Sample size estimates indicate that regional cortical thickness difference of 0.2 mm between two different groups could be identified with as few as 7 subjects per group, and a difference of 0.1 mm could be detected with 26 subjects per group. These results demonstrate that MRI-derived cortical thickness measures are highly reliable when MRI instrument and data processing factors are controlled but that it is important to consider these factors in the design of multi-site or longitudinal studies, such as clinical drug trials. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {There is a substantial need for discovering innovative ways to provide more information on the neurobiology of alcohol dependence as well as to discover more effective pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence. Current research includes exploring new pathways able to modulate alcohol craving. In particular, research shows that several neuroendocrinological pathways may be involved in the neurobiology of alcohol craving and dependence. The first part of this review examines recent clinical findings on the role of feeding-related peptides in alcohol craving and dependence. Second, this review focuses on the need to discover new medications that may prove to be safe and effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence. For example, the GABA(B) receptor has been suggested as a new possible neuropharmacological target in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Accordingly, the second part of this review examines recent clinical findings on the role of the selective GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen in the treatment of alcohol-dependent subjects. These two distinct topics will be both analyzed and discussed. The final part of this review discusses possible connections between these two topics, as an example of possible interactions between psychoneuroendocrinology and neuropharmacology. These possible interactions could lead to future intriguing research aimed at understanding and treating alcohol craving and dependence.},

Bleuler's methods are contrasted with Kraepelin's, and 4 myths about his concept of schizophrenia addressed. We demonstrate that (1) Bleuler's concept of schizophrenia has close ties to historical and contemporary concepts of dissociation and as such the public interpretation of schizophrenia as split personality has some historical basis; (2) Bleuler's concept of loosening of associations does not refer narrowly to a disorder of thought but broadly to a core organically based psychological deficit which underlies the other symptoms of schizophrenia; (3) the "4 A's," for association, affect, ambivalence, and autism, do not adequately summarize Bleuler's teachings on schizophrenia and marginalize the central role of splitting in his conception; and (4) Bleuler's ideas were more powerfully influenced by Pierre Janet, particularly with regard to his diagnostic category Psychasthenia, than by Sigmund Freud. We conclude that Bleuler's ideas on schizophrenia warrant reexamination in the light of current criticism of the emphasis on psychotic symptoms in the schizophrenia diagnosis and argue for the recognition of the dissociative roots of this most important psychiatric category.},

abstract = {From 1959 until 1969, Heidegger lectured to psychiatrists and psychiatry students at the University of Zurich Psychiatric Clinic and in Zollikon. The transcriptions of these lectures were published as the Zollikon Seminars. In these seminars Heidegger is highly critical of psychoanalysis, because of its causal and objectifying approach to the human being. In general, Heidegger considers it an objectification or even an elimination of the human being to approach a patient from a causal perspective. In our view Heidegger has overlooked the peculiar nature and complexity of psychotherapy and psychiatry, namely that psychiatry is not just a discipline that combines a hermeneutical approach and a natural science approach on a theoretical level, but it also deals with psychopathology in practice. We argue, also referring to Strawson and Gadamer, that in psychiatric practice causal explanation and hermeneutic understanding are no mutually exclusive approaches. We conclude that the encounter of philosophy and psychiatry in matters of causality and motivation could be particularly fruitful when the practical situation is addressed, recognizing the special character of psychopathology.},

Since DSM-5 Work Groups have recently proposed revisions for the major diagnostic classes of mental disorders, an article on the current status of the personality disorders (PDs) is timely. This article reviews scientific principles that have influenced the development of proposed changes for the assessment and diagnosis of personality psychopathology in DSM-5, presents the proposed model as of the summer of 2011, summarizes rationales for the changes, and discusses critiques of the model. Scientific principles were articulated for DSM-5 more than a decade ago; their application to the process has not been straightforward, however. Work Group members have labored to improve the DSM-5 approach to personality and PDs to make the classification more valid and more clinically useful. The current model continues to be a work in progress.},

abstract = {Brief self-report screening can help facilitate early identification of individuals at risk for or in early stages of psychosis. Existing screening tools focus on self-reported attenuated positive symptoms to detect potential risk; however, parent reports may also be helpful for assessing symptoms, especially in younger patients. Recent evidence has shown that the "atypicality" scale within the self-report form of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) may be useful for identifying high-risk youth within a more clinically comprehensive and potentially minimally stigmatizing format. The BASC-2 parent report form also includes the atypicality scale, but no research has investigated the relation of this scale to psychosis risk. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the association of parent along with youth reports of BASC-2 atypicality with attenuated positive symptoms as assessed by the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS), in a sample of help-seeking adolescents (n=63). Results indicate that both parent and youth reports of atypicality predict clinician-rated symptoms. Moreover, the combination of parent and youth report significantly improved prediction of SIPS scores over either single-informant scale. These findings suggest that parent report scales, as ascertained through part of a larger, commonly used measure, may help identify youth at risk for psychosis, particularly if used in conjunction with youth self-report.},

abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of drug widely used for treatment of mood disorders, including depression and cardiovascular disease. A search for related articles in the PubMed database was attempted. It covered studies, reports, reviews and editorials of the last 5 years. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1 and IL-6, stimulate central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission and are over-expressed in depression, which has been linked with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hyperactivity. They have also been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of other stress-induced disorders, like myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary heart disease (CHD), as they seem to modulate cardiovascular function by a variety of mechanisms. Biological mechanisms like these may explain the link between depression and CHD. There are a variety of environmental factors as well as genetic factors that might influence the pharmacogenetics of antidepressant drugs. New generation selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) causing a reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may be related to serotonin platelet abnormalities in depressed patients that are effectively treated by SSRIs. SSRIs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram are not only considered to be free from the cardiotoxicity of their predecessors but also to function as safe and efficacious agents against depression, platelet activation, atherosclerosis and development and prognosis of coronary heart disease. However, there is a need for more studies in order to establish the exact biochemical mechanisms that are responsible for these diseases and the immunoregulatory effects of chronic use of SSRI medications.},

The condition is also known as "psychosis risk syndrome," "at-risk mental state," "ultra-high risk," and "putative prodrome." We review evidence favoring its inclusion as a new diagnosis in DSM-5 and report new preliminary findings on DSM-IV diagnoses in current clinical use for these patients and on results of diagnostic interviews in unselected volunteers. The main evidence supporting inclusion is: (1) the patients are currently ill, (2) the patients are at high risk for getting worse, (3) no DSM-IV diagnosis accurately captures their current illness or future risk, (4) the diagnosis has been made with reliability and validity in the research setting, and (5) placement in DSM-5 would help promote the needed treatment and prevention research to enable articulation of a standard of care to benefit these patients and their families. Potential harms can be minimized by patient, family, and provider education. It will be important to demonstrate through well-designed field trials whether the diagnostic criteria can be used with reliability in everyday clinical practice.},

Personality is an overall organization that allows the organism to accomplish basic goals within the constraints of its basic traits and specific intentional states. Extreme traits can be negative or "dysfunctional" in the sense that they interfere with the achievement of socially or personally valued goals; however, they are not necessarily dysfunctions or disorders in the biological or medical sense. Thus, no sheer assessment of a set of traits can offer sufficient information for a diagnosis of personality disorder. Nor do criteria such as maladaptiveness, impairment, or clinical significance necessarily transform a trait into a personality disorder. The DSM's most plausible suggestion for judging when traits are dysfunctions, inflexibility, is also problematic because many nondisordered traits are inflexible as well.},

@article{Reichenberg2005,
abstract = {Since the time of Kraepelin and Bleuler, it has been recognized that schizophrenia is associated with a profound and persistent cognitive impairment. This paper reviews the major clinical and epidemiological studies of cognitive functioning in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and presents several possible models to explain the association between cognitive impairment and psychosis. Cognitive impairment is present in the majority of patients with schizophrenia, and, in some, it is already evident in the premorbid stages of the disorder. This cognitive impairment is not secondary to psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, or socioeconomic status. Cognitive impairment can also be observed in nonpsychotic family members of psychotic patients. On the basis of this evidence, it has been proposed that abnormal cognitive functioning can be considered as a possible causal risk factor for psychosis. Recent studies assessing the relationship between genetic background, cognition, brain function, and schizophrenia are presented here as an outline for future research.},

@article{Yang2010,
abstract = {While the "clinical high-risk state" for psychosis has demonstrated good reliability and fair predictive validity for psychotic disorders, over 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of identified subjects do not progress to psychosis. Despite the benefits that early detection and treatment might offer, debate concerning the official inclusion of a "psychosis risk syndrome" in the upcoming DSM-V frequently involves concerns about the impact of stigma on patients, families and institutions. We add to this debate by providing an analysis of the theoretical and empirical stigma literature to evaluate the potential effects of stigma associated with the psychosis risk syndrome. Theorists' conceptualizations of how stigma exerts its negative effects emphasize internalization of pejorative societal stereotypes ('self-stigma'), negative emotional reactions, harmful behavioral coping strategies, and structural discrimination as key mechanisms. Studies assessing the comparative effects of symptomatic behavior when compared with a psychiatric diagnosis label in predicting rejecting social attitudes indicate that treating symptomatic behaviors is likely to diminish overall stigma. However, any publically held 'preexisting conceptions' about what a psychosis risk syndrome means are still likely to exert negative effects. Additionally, particular features of this syndrome--that it occurs during adolescence when identity formation may be in flux--may also shape manifestations of stigma. Utilizing other well-established 'at-risk' conditions (e.g., genetic susceptibility) to model potential discrimination for this syndrome, we suggest that future discrimination is likely to occur in insurance and family domains. We conclude by proposing stigma measurement strategies, including recommending that field trials prior to DSM-V adopt systematic measures to assess any stigma that this psychosis risk syndrome might confer via future community use.},
